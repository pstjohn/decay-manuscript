abstract = {This overview paper presents and compares different methods traditionally used for estimating damped sinusoid parameters. Firstly, direct nonlinear least squares fitting the signal model in the time and frequency domains are described. Next, possible applications of the Hilbert transform for signal demodulation are presented. Then, a wide range of autoregressive modelling methods, valid for damped sinusoids, are discussed, in which frequency and damping are estimated from calculated signal linear self-prediction coefficients. These methods aim at solving, directly or using least squares, a matrix linear equation in which signal or its autocorrelation function samples are used. The Prony, Steiglitz-McBride, Kumaresan-Tufts, Total Least Squares, Matrix Pencil, Yule- Walker and Pisarenko methods are taken into account. Finally, the interpolated discrete Fourier transform is presented with examples of Bertocco, Yoshida, and Agre\v{z} algorithms. The Matlab codes of all the discussed methods are given. The second part of the paper presents simulation results, compared with the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and commented. All tested methods are compared with respect to their accuracy (systematic errors), noise robustness, required signal length, and computational complexity.},

abstract = {Biological clocks with a period of approximately 24 h (circadian) exist in most organisms and time a variety of functions, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, bioluminescence, and core body temperature fluctuations. Much of our understanding of the clock mechanism comes from the identification of specific mutations that affect circadian behavior. A widely studied mutation in casein kinase I (CKI), the CKIepsilon(tau) mutant, has been shown to cause a loss of kinase function in vitro, but it has been difficult to reconcile this loss of function with the current model of circadian clock function. Here we show that mathematical modeling predicts the opposite, that the kinase mutant CKIepsilon(tau) increases kinase activity, and we verify this prediction experimentally. CKIepsilon(tau) is a highly specific gain-of-function mutation that increases the in vivo phosphorylation and degradation of the circadian regulators PER1 and PER2. These findings experimentally validate a mathematical modeling approach to a complex biological function, clarify the role of CKI in the clock, and demonstrate that a specific mutation can be both a gain and a loss of function depending on the substrate.},

abstract = {Microarray provides genome-wide transcript profiles, whereas RNA-seq is an alternative approach applied for transcript discovery and genome annotation. Both high-throughput techniques show quantitative measurement of gene expression. To explore differential gene expression rates and understand biological functions, the authors designed a system which utilises annotations from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) associations for integrating multiple RNA-seq or microarray datasets. The developed system is initiated by either estimating gene expression levels from mapping next generation sequencing short reads onto reference genomes or performing intensity analysis from microarray raw images. Normalisation procedures on expression levels are evaluated and compared through different approaches including Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) and housekeeping gene selection. Such gene expression levels are shown in different colour shades and graphically displayed in designed temporal pathways. To enhance importance of functional relationships of clustered genes, representative GO terms associated with differentially expressed gene cluster are visually illustrated in a tag cloud representation.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms govern a wide variety of physiological and metabolic functions in many organisms, from prokaryotes to humans. We previously reported that silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, contributes to circadian control. In addition, SIRT1 activity is regulated in a cyclic manner in virtue of the circadian oscillation of the coenzyme NAD(+). Here we used specific SIRT1 activator compounds both in vitro and in vivo. We tested a variety of compounds to show that the activation of SIRT1 alters CLOCK:BMAL1-driven transcription in different systems. Activation of SIRT1 induces repression of circadian gene expression and decreases H3 K9/K14 acetylation at corresponding promoters in a time-specific manner. Specific activation of SIRT1 was demonstrated in vivo using liver-specific SIRT1-deficient mice, where the effect of SIRT1 activator compounds was shown to be dependent on SIRT1. Our findings demonstrate that SIRT1 can fine-tune circadian rhythm and pave the way to the development of pharmacological strategies to address a broad range of therapeutic indications.},

abstract = {Resveratrol induces mitochondrial biogenesis and protects against metabolic decline, but whether SIRT1 mediates these benefits is the subject of debate. To circumvent the developmental defects of germline SIRT1 knockouts, we have developed an inducible system that permits whole-body deletion of SIRT1 in adult mice. Mice treated with a moderate dose of resveratrol showed increased mitochondrial biogenesis and function, AMPK activation, and increased NAD(+) levels in skeletal muscle, whereas SIRT1 knockouts displayed none of these benefits. A mouse overexpressing SIRT1 mimicked these effects. A high dose of resveratrol activated AMPK in a SIRT1-independent manner, demonstrating that resveratrol dosage is a critical factor. Importantly, at both doses of resveratrol no improvements in mitochondrial function were observed in animals lacking SIRT1. Together these data indicate that SIRT1 plays an essential role in the ability of moderate doses of resveratrol to stimulate AMPK and improve mitochondrial function both in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract = {The circadian clock coordinates daily oscillations of essential physiological and behavioral processes. Conversely, aberrant clocks with damped amplitude and/or abnormal period have been associated with chronic diseases and aging. To search for small molecules that perturb or enhance circadian rhythms, we conducted a high-throughput screen of approximately 200,000 synthetic compounds using Per2lucSV reporter fibroblast cells and validated 11 independent classes of molecules with Bmal1:luciferase reporter cells as well as with suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissue explants. Four compounds were found to lengthen the period in both central and peripheral clocks, including three compounds that inhibited casein kinase I$\epsilon$ in vitro and a unique benzodiazepine derivative acting through a non-GABA(A) receptor target. In addition, two compounds acutely induced Per2lucSV reporter bioluminescence, delayed the rhythm, and increased intracellular cAMP levels, but caused rhythm damping. Importantly, five compounds shortened the period of peripheral clocks; among them, four compounds also enhanced the amplitude of central and/or peripheral reporter rhythms. Taken together, these studies highlight diverse activities of drug-like small molecules in manipulating the central and peripheral clocks. These small molecules constitute a toolbox for probing clock regulatory mechanisms and may provide putative lead compounds for treatment of clock-associated diseases.},

In particular, we explore the interplay among stimulus duration, baseline firing frequency, and population-level response patterns.

abstract = {Cellular networks multitask by exhibiting distinct, context-dependent dynamics. However, network states (parameters) that generate a particular dynamic are often sub-optimal for others, defining a source of "tension" between them. Though multitasking is pervasive, it is not clear where tension arises, what consequences it has, and how it is resolved. We developed a generic computational framework to examine the source and consequences of tension between pairs of dynamics exhibited by the well-studied RB-E2F switch regulating cell cycle entry. We found that tension arose from task-dependent shifts in parameters associated with network modules. Although parameter sets common to distinct dynamics did exist, tension reduced both their accessibility and resilience to perturbation, indicating a trade-off between "one-size-fits-all" solutions and robustness. With high tension, robustness can be preserved by dynamic shifting of modules, enabling the network to toggle between tasks, and by increasing network complexity, in this case by gene duplication. We propose that tension is a general constraint on the architecture and operation of multitasking biological networks. To this end, our work provides a framework to quantify the extent of tension between any network dynamics and how it affects network robustness. Such analysis would suggest new ways to interfere with network elements to elucidate the design principles of cellular networks.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a small structure at the base of the hypothalamus. While light effects on the SCN are well established, little is known of behavioral effects. This study elucidates direct modulating action of behavioral activity on the SCN by use of in vivo electrophysiology recordings, assessments of general locomotor behavior, and video-tracking of mice. The results show suppression of SCN neuronal activity by spontaneous behavior, the magnitude being dependent on the intensity, duration and type of behavioral activity. The suppression was moderate (32\% of circadian amplitude) for low-intensity behavior and considerable (59\%) for locomotor activity. Mild manipulation of the animals had reversed effects on the SCN indicating that different mechanisms are involved in the regulatory effect of spontaneous versus induced activity. The results indicate that exercise at the proper time of the cycle can boost the amplitude of the rhythm of the SCN clock itself. This has potentially beneficial effects for other rhythmic functions that are under the control of the SCN.},

abstract = {Many biochemical, physiological and behavioural processes show circadian rhythms which are generated by an internal time-keeping mechanism referred to as the biological clock. According to rapidly developing models, the core oscillator driving this clock is composed of an autoregulatory transcription-(post) translation-based feedback loop involving a set of 'dock' genes. Molecular clocks do not oscillate with an exact 24-hour rhythmicity but are entrained to solar day/night rhythms by light. The mammalian proteins Cryl and Cry2, which are members of the family of plant blue-light receptors (cryptochromes) and photolyases, have been proposed as candidate light receptors for photoentrainment of the biological clock. Here we show that mice lacking the Cryl or Cry2 protein display accelerated and delayed free-running periodicity of locomotor activity, respectively. Strikingly, in the absence of both proteins, an instantaneous and complete loss of free-running rhythmicity is observed. This suggests that, in addition to a possible photoreceptor and antagonistic clock-adjusting function, both proteins are essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are 24-h timing devices that phase cellular responses; coordinate growth, physiology, and metabolism; and anticipate the day-night cycle. Here we report sensitivity of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian oscillator to sucrose, providing evidence that plant metabolism can regulate circadian function. We found that the Arabidopsis circadian system is particularly sensitive to sucrose in the dark. These data suggest that there is a feedback between the molecular components that comprise the circadian oscillator and plant metabolism, with the circadian clock both regulating and being regulated by metabolism. We used also simulations within a three-loop mathematical model of the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator to identify components of the circadian clock sensitive to sucrose. The mathematical studies identified GIGANTEA (GI) as being associated with sucrose sensing. Experimental validation of this prediction demonstrated that GI is required for the full response of the circadian clock to sucrose. We demonstrate that GI acts as part of the sucrose-signaling network and propose this role permits metabolic input into circadian timing in Arabidopsis.},

@article{DeJong2002,
abstract = {In order to understand the functioning of organisms on the molecular level, we need to know which genes are expressed, when and where in the organism, and to which extent. The regulation of gene expression is achieved through genetic regulatory systems structured by networks of interactions between DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. As most genetic regulatory networks of interest involve many components connected through interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, an intuitive understanding of their dynamics is hard to obtain. As a consequence, formal methods and computer tools for the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks will be indispensable. This paper reviews formalisms that have been employed in mathematical biology and bioinformatics to describe genetic regulatory systems, in particular directed graphs, Bayesian networks, Boolean networks and their generalizations, ordinary and partial differential equations, qualitative differential equations, stochastic equations, and rule-based formalisms. In addition, the paper discusses how these formalisms have been used in the simulation of the behavior of actual regulatory systems.},

@article{Shackney1999,
abstract = {Some cell cycle models assume that cells are normally in a quiescent state until they are stimulated to enter the cell cycle and proceed through an S phase of fixed duration. Other models assume that cells normally cycle rapidly until they undergo growth retardation, proceed through an S phase of longer duration, and then undergo apoptosis or cell differentiation preferentially. These seemingly contradictory model types can be reconciled by restricting the latter type to the transition from log phase to plateau phase growth, and the former type to the recruitment of slowly proliferating cells into rapid cycle. Both proliferative states can be unified in a single cell cycle model that recognizes differences in the behavior of rapidly dividing and slowly dividing cells in the same population. Rb appears to play a major role in protecting slowly proliferating cells from apoptosis, permitting them to differentiate or persist as reserve cells that can be recruited into rapid cycle under appropriate circumstances. We examine the mechanistic basis for the recruitment phenomenon in some detail. The mitogenic signaling pathway is divided into a proximal segment, which consists of growth factor-induced membrane signaling, commonly through ras, raf, and cyclin D/cdk Rb kinase activation, and is subject to checks and balances that are designed to limit the propagation of the mitogenic signal. ras and raf compete with wild-type p53 both with respect to mitogenic signal propagation at the Rb node, and, separately, with respect to apoptosis/anti-apoptosis. The distal segment of the mitogenic signaling pathway, which consists of Rb phosphorylation, the release of E2F, the induction of c-myc, cyclins E and A, and DNA synthesis, is distinguished by a multiplicity of nested positive feedback loops; these would be expected to drive a mitogenic signal that entered the distal segment through at least one round of DNA synthesis. Using this model, we can identify two separate mechanistic strategies for neoplastic transformation. Chronic mitogenic stimulation of slowly proliferating cells would appear to be a common feature of Rb +/+ tumors. Rb -/- tumors dispense with the early segment of the mitogenic signaling pathway and its anti-apoptotic features, and maintain rapid cell cycling to compensate for high apoptotic rates.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

Blood glucose levels, therefore, are carefully maintained. The liver plays a central role in this process by balancing the uptake and storage of glucose via glycogenesis and the release of glucose via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The several substrate cycles in the major metabolic pathways of the liver play key roles in the regulation of glucose production. In this review, we focus on the short- and long-term regulation glucose-6-phosphatase and its substrate cycle counter-part, glucokinase. The substrate cycle enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the terminal step in both the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways and is opposed by the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase. In addition, we include the regulation of GLUT 2, which facilitates the final step in the transport of glucose out of the liver and into the bloodstream.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators driving daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. Synchronization of these timers to environmental light-dark cycles ('entrainment') is crucial for an organism's fitness. Little is known about which oscillator qualities determine entrainment, i.e., entrainment range, phase and amplitude. In a systematic theoretical and experimental study, we uncovered these qualities for circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN-the master clock in mammals) and the lung (a peripheral clock): (i) the ratio between stimulus (zeitgeber) strength and oscillator amplitude and (ii) the rigidity of the oscillatory system (relaxation rate upon perturbation) determine entrainment properties. Coupling among oscillators affects both qualities resulting in increased amplitude and rigidity. These principles explain our experimental findings that lung clocks entrain to extreme zeitgeber cycles, whereas SCN clocks do not. We confirmed our theoretical predictions by showing that pharmacological inhibition of coupling in the SCN leads to larger ranges of entrainment. These differences between master and the peripheral clocks suggest that coupling-induced rigidity in the SCN filters environmental noise to create a robust circadian system.},

The molecular mechanisms controlling the synchronization of the circadian pacemaker are unknown; however, immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the SCN is tightly correlated with entrainment of SCN-regulated rhythms. Antibodies were isolated that recognize the activated, phosphorylated form of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB). Within minutes after exposure of hamsters to light, CREB in the SCN became phosphorylated on the transcriptional regulatory site, Ser133. CREB phosphorylation was dependent on circadian time: CREB became phosphorylated only at times during the circadian cycle when light induced IEG expression and caused phase shifts of circadian rhythms. These results implicate CREB in neuronal signaling in the hypothalamus and suggest that circadian clock gating of light-regulated molecular responses in the SCN occurs upstream of phosphorylation of CREB.},

We report the development of a high-throughput circadian functional assay system that consists of luminescent reporter cells, screening automation, and a data analysis pipeline. We applied this system to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian circadian clock using a chemical biology approach. We analyzed the effect of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds with diverse structures on the circadian period length that is indicative of the core clock mechanism. Our screening paradigm identified many compounds previously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating the validity of the assay system. Furthermore, we found that small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) consistently caused a strong short period phenotype in contrast to the well-known period lengthening by lithium, another presumed GSK-3 inhibitor. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GSK-3beta also caused a short period, confirming the phenotype obtained with the small molecule inhibitors. These results clarify the role of GSK-3beta in the period regulation of the mammalian clockworks and highlight the effectiveness of chemical biology in exploring unidentified mechanisms of the circadian clock.},

We demonstrate that (i) the ftsZ and zipN genes are essential for the viability of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Finally, we have also characterized a novel Z-interacting protein, ZipN, the N-terminal DnaJ domain of which is critical to the decoration of the Z-ring, and we report that this process is independent of MinCDE.},

abstract = {CRYPTOCHOME proteins are necessary for mammalian circadian rhythms and have many well-established biochemical roles within the molecular clock. While studies examining the effect of null Cry alleles have been informative, they have failed to dissect out the relative importance of, and the molecular mechanisms behind, the many roles of the CRY1 and CRY2 proteins. To address this, we created an allelic series of Cry mutants through random mutagenesis, followed by a cell-based screen to isolate mutants with aberrant repression of CLOCK-BMAL1. We identified 22 mutants with mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions which cause a variety of deficiencies in different CRY functions. To illustrate the breadth and value of these new tools, we present an in-depth analysis of two of these mutants, CRY2G354D and CRY2G351D; the former shows deficiency in clock protein binding and is required for repression by both CRYs, while in contrast, the latter displays normal binding function but exhibits a CRY2-specific repression phenotype. Further, while overexpression of CRY2 in NIH 3T3 cells caused a dose-dependent decrease in rhythm amplitude, overexpression of CRY2G351D abolished rhythmicity. In summary, characterization of these unique alleles provides new opportunities for more-sophisticated insight into the multifaceted functions of the CRY proteins in circadian rhythms.},

@article{Guenthner2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatocytes, the parenchymal cells of the liver, express core clock genes, such as Period2 and Cryptochrome2, which are involved in the transcriptional/translational feedback loop of the circadian clock. Whether or not the liver is capable of sustaining rhythms independent of a central pacemaker is controversial. Whether and how circadian information may be shared among cells in the liver in order to sustain oscillations is currently unknown. RESULTS: In this study we isolated primary hepatocytes from transgenic Per2(Luc) mice and used bioluminescence as a read-out of the state of the circadian clock. Hepatocytes cultured in a collagen gel sandwich configuration exhibited persistent circadian rhythms for several weeks. The amplitude of the rhythms damped, but medium changes consistently reset the phase and amplitude of the cultures. Cry2(-/-) Per2(Luc) cells oscillated robustly and expressed a longer period. Co-culturing with wildtype cells did not significantly shorten the period, indicating that coupling among hepatocytes is insufficient to synchronize cells with significantly differing periods. However, spatial patterns revealed by cellular imaging of wildtype cultures provided evidence of weak local coupling among the hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results with primary hepatocyte cultures demonstrate that cultured hepatocytes are weakly coupled. While this coupling is not sufficient to sustain global synchrony, it does increase local synchrony, which may stabilize the circadian rhythms of peripheral oscillators, such as the liver, against noise in the entraining signals.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks involve feedback loops that generate rhythmic expression of key genes. Molecular genetic studies in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed a complex clock network. The first part of the network to be identified, a transcriptional feedback loop comprising TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1), LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), fails to account for significant experimental data. We develop an extended model that is based upon a wider range of data and accurately predicts additional experimental results. The model comprises interlocking feedback loops comparable to those identified experimentally in other circadian systems. We propose that each loop receives input signals from light, and that each loop includes a hypothetical component that had not been explicitly identified. Analysis of the model predicted the properties of these components, including an acute light induction at dawn that is rapidly repressed by LHY and CCA1. We found this unexpected regulation in RNA levels of the evening-expressed gene GIGANTEA (GI), supporting our proposed network and making GI a strong candidate for this component.},

abstract = {Posttranslational regulation of clock proteins is an essential part of mammalian circadian rhythms, conferring sensitivity to metabolic state and offering promising targets for pharmacological control. Two such regulators, casein kinase 1 (CKI) and F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (FBXL3), modulate the stability of closely linked core clock proteins period (PER) and cryptochrome (CRY), respectively. Inhibition of either CKI or FBXL3 leads to longer periods, and their effects are independent despite targeting proteins with similar roles in clock function. A mechanistic understanding of this independence, however, has remained elusive. Our analysis of cellular circadian clock gene reporters further differentiated between the actions of CKI and FBXL3 by revealing opposite amplitude responses from each manipulation. To understand the functional relationship between the CKI-PER and FBXL3-CRY pathways, we generated robust mechanistic predictions by applying a bootstrap uncertainty analysis to multiple mathematical circadian models. Our results indicate that CKI primarily regulates the accumulating phase of the PER-CRY repressive complex by controlling the nuclear import rate, whereas FBXL3 separately regulates the duration of transcriptional repression in the nucleus. Dynamic simulations confirmed that this spatiotemporal separation is able to reproduce the independence of the two regulators in period regulation, as well as their opposite amplitude effect. As a result, this study provides further insight into the molecular clock machinery responsible for maintaining robust circadian rhythms.},

abstract = {We present a computational model for the mammalian circadian clock based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, Clock, and Rev-Erb alpha genes. In agreement with experimental observations, the model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness, characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per/Cry/Rev-Erbalpha and Bmal1 mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.},

Whereas the master clock in the brain is set by light, pacemakers in peripheral organs, such as the liver, are reset by food availability, although the setting, or "entrainment," mechanisms remain mysterious. Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks. Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs.},

abstract = {Diminished mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic capacity are associated with reduced longevity. We tested whether resveratrol (RSV), which is known to extend lifespan, impacts mitochondrial function and metabolic homeostasis. Treatment of mice with RSV significantly increased their aerobic capacity, as evidenced by their increased running time and consumption of oxygen in muscle fibers. RSV's effects were associated with an induction of genes for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and were largely explained by an RSV-mediated decrease in PGC-1alpha acetylation and an increase in PGC-1alpha activity. This mechanism is consistent with RSV being a known activator of the protein deacetylase, SIRT1, and by the lack of effect of RSV in SIRT1(-/-) MEFs. Importantly, RSV treatment protected mice against diet-induced-obesity and insulin resistance. These pharmacological effects of RSV combined with the association of three Sirt1 SNPs and energy homeostasis in Finnish subjects implicates SIRT1 as a key regulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis.},

@article{Jewett1998,
abstract = {In 1990, Kronauer proposed a mathematical model of the effects of light on the human circadian pacemaker. Although this model predicted many general features of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light exposure, additional data now available enable us to refine the original model. We first refined the original model by incorporating the results of a dose response curve to light into the model's predicted relationship between light intensity and the strength of the drive onto the pacemaker. Data from three bright light phase resetting experiments were then used to refine the amplitude recovery characteristics of the model. Finally, the model was tested and further refined using data from an extensive phase resetting experiment in which a 3-cycle bright light stimulus was presented against a background of dim light. In order to describe the results of the four resetting experiments, the following major refinements to the original model were necessary: (i) the relationship between light intensity (I) and drive onto the pacemaker was reduced from I1/3 to I0.23 for light levels between 150 and 10,000 lux; (ii) the van der Pol oscillator from the original model was replaced with a higher-order limit cycle oscillator so that amplitude recovery is slower near the singularity and faster near the limit cycle; (iii) a direct effect of light on circadian period (tau x) was incorporated into the model such that as I increases, tau x decreases, which is in accordance with "Aschoff's rule". This refined model generates the following testable predictions: it should be difficult to enhance normal circadian amplitude via bright light; near the critical point of a type 0 phase response curve (PRC) the slope should be steeper than it is in a type 1 PRC; and circadian period measured during forced desynchrony should be directly affected by ambient light intensity.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance and elevated glucagon levels result in nonsuppressible hepatic glucose production and hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. The CREB coactivator complex controls transcription of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme genes. Here, we show that both the antidiabetic agent metformin and insulin phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) at serine 436 via PKC iota/lambda. This event triggers the dissociation of the CREB-CBP-TORC2 transcription complex and reduces gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Mice carrying a germline mutation of this CBP phosphorylation site (S436A) demonstrate resistance to the hypoglycemic effect of both insulin and metformin. Obese, hyperglycemic mice display hepatic insulin resistance, but metformin is still effective in treating the hyperglycemia of these mice since it stimulates CBP phosphorylation by bypassing the block in insulin signaling. Our findings point to CBP phosphorylation at Ser436 by metformin as critical for its therapeutic effect, and as a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention.},

Like the metabolic system, the circadian system is a complex feedback network that involves interactions between the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Emerging evidence suggests that circadian regulation is intimately linked to metabolic homeostasis and that dysregulation of circadian rhythms can contribute to disease. Conversely, metabolic signals also feed back into the circadian system, modulating circadian gene expression and behavior. Here, we review the relationship between the circadian and metabolic systems and the implications for cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.},

abstract = {Post-translational processes are essential for the generation and dynamics of mammalian circadian rhythms. In particular, phosphorylation of the key circadian protein PER2 precisely controls the period and phase of circadian oscillations. However, the mechanisms underlying that control are poorly understood. Here, we identified in a high-throughput RNAi-based genetic screen casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a PER2-phosphorylating kinase and novel component of the mammalian circadian clock. When CK2 subunits are silenced by RNAi or when CK2 activity is inhibited pharmacologically, circadian rhythms are disrupted. CK2 binds to PER2 in vivo, phosphorylates PER2 specifically at N-terminal residues in vitro, and supports normal nuclear PER2 accumulation. Mutation of CK2 phosphorylation sites decreases PER2 stability and copies CK2 inhibition regarding oscillation dynamics. We propose a new concept of how PER2 phosphorylation and stabilization can set the clock speed in opposite directions, dependent on the phase of action.},

A reduced model must retain essential features of the full model, which, traditionally, have been the trajectories of certain state variables. For biological clocks, timing, or phase, characteristics must be preserved. A key performance criterion for a clock is the ability to adjust its phase correctly in response to external signals. We present a novel model reduction technique that removes components from a single-oscillator clock model and discover that four feedback loops are redundant with respect to its phase response behavior. Using a coupled multioscillator model of a circadian clock, we demonstrate that by preserving the phase response behavior of a single oscillator, we preserve timing behavior at the multioscillator level.},

Here we show that the ATPase activity of KaiC satisfies the characteristics of the circadian oscillation, the period length, and the temperature compensation. KaiC possesses extremely weak but stable ATPase activity (15 molecules of ATP per day), and the addition of KaiA and KaiB makes the activity oscillate with a circadian period in vitro. The ATPase activity of KaiC is inherently temperature-invariant, suggesting that temperature compensation of the circadian period could be driven by this simple biochemical reaction. Moreover, the activities of wild-type KaiC and five period-mutant proteins are directly proportional to their in vivo circadian frequencies, indicating that the ATPase activity defines the circadian period. Thus, we propose that KaiC ATPase activity constitutes the most fundamental reaction underlying circadian periodicity in cyanobacteria.},

The distribution of time intervals between successive neuronal firings (interresponse time histogram), the firing rate as a function of input frequency, the variability in the time course of depolarization from trial to trial, and the strength-duration curve are derived for this model. The predictions are compared with data from the literature and good qualitative agreement is found. All parameters are experimentally measurable and a direct test of the theory is possible with present techniques.

abstract = {Cell-autonomous and self-sustained molecular oscillators drive circadian behavior and physiology in mammals. From rhythms recorded in cultured fibroblasts we identified the dominant cause for amplitude reduction as desynchronization of self-sustained oscillators. Here, we propose a general framework for quantifying luminescence signals from biochemical oscillators, both in populations and individual cells. Our model combines three essential aspects of circadian clocks: the stability of the limit cycle, fluctuations, and intercellular coupling. From population recordings we can simultaneously estimate the stiffness of individual frequencies, the period dispersion, and the interaction strength. Consistent with previous work, coupling is found to be weak and insufficient to synchronize cells. Moreover, we find that frequency fluctuations remain correlated for longer than one clock cycle, which is confirmed from individual cell recordings. Using genetic models for circadian clocks, we show that this reflects the stability properties of the underlying circadian limit-cycle oscillators, and we identify biochemical parameters that influence oscillator stability in mammals. Our study thus points to stabilizing mechanisms that dampen fluctuations to maintain accurate timing in peripheral circadian oscillators.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the DNA methylation of clock genes changes with age and contributes to circadian dysfunction in aged animals.

METHODS: We examined the methylation of clock promoters in the stomach, kidney, striatum, and spleen by using a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay.

RESULTS: Our results show that different tissues exhibit specific patterns of clock methylation. Additionally, methylation frequency decreased significantly in older mice at the Per1 promoter in the stomach, but it was significantly increased in older mice at the Cry1, Bmal2, and Npas2 promoters in the spleen.

CONCLUSION: The findings from our study suggest that DNA methylation contribute to age-related changes in circadian rhythms in certain slave oscillators.},

The key to applying such methods to nonequilibrium processes is the accumulation of fluxes between regions. A significant difference between microscopically reversible and irreversible systems is that, in the latter case, the transition path ensemble for a reaction can be significantly different for "forward" and "backward" trajectories. Here, we show how to separately treat forward and backward pathways in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling simulations by working in an extended space. In this extended space, the exact rate (for equilibrium or nonequilibrium processes) can be calculated "for free" as a flux in phase space. We compare the efficiency of this rate calculation with forward flux sampling for a two-dimensional potential and show that nonequilibrium umbrella sampling is more efficient when an intermediate is present. We show that this technique can also be used to describe steady-state limit cycles by examining a simulation of circadian oscillations. We obtain the path of the limit cycle in a space of 22 order parameters, as well as the oscillation period. The relation of our method to others is discussed.},

Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

While oscillators in SCN neurons are known to function in a self-sustained fashion, peripheral oscillators have been thought to damp rapidly when disconnected from the control exerted by the SCN. Using two reporter systems, we monitored circadian gene expression in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts in real time and in individual cells. In conjunction with mathematical modeling and cell co-culture experiments, these data demonstrated that in vitro cultured fibroblasts harbor self-sustained and cell-autonomous circadian clocks similar to those operative in SCN neurons. Circadian gene expression in fibroblasts continues during cell division, and our experiments unveiled unexpected interactions between the circadian clock and the cell division clock. Specifically, the circadian oscillator gates cytokinesis to defined time windows, and mitosis elicits phase shifts in circadian cycles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We consider the problem of parameter estimation (model calibration) in nonlinear dynamic models of biological systems. Due to the frequent ill-conditioning and multi-modality of many of these problems, traditional local methods usually fail (unless initialized with very good guesses of the parameter vector). In order to surmount these difficulties, global optimization (GO) methods have been suggested as robust alternatives. Currently, deterministic GO methods can not solve problems of realistic size within this class in reasonable computation times. In contrast, certain types of stochastic GO methods have shown promising results, although the computational cost remains large. Rodriguez-Fernandez and coworkers have presented hybrid stochastic-deterministic GO methods which could reduce computation time by one order of magnitude while guaranteeing robustness. Our goal here was to further reduce the computational effort without loosing robustness. RESULTS: We have developed a new procedure based on the scatter search methodology for nonlinear optimization of dynamic models of arbitrary (or even unknown) structure (i.e. black-box models). In this contribution, we describe and apply this novel metaheuristic, inspired by recent developments in the field of operations research, to a set of complex identification problems and we make a critical comparison with respect to the previous (above mentioned) successful methods. CONCLUSION: Robust and efficient methods for parameter estimation are of key importance in systems biology and related areas. The new metaheuristic presented in this paper aims to ensure the proper solution of these problems by adopting a global optimization approach, while keeping the computational effort under reasonable values. This new metaheuristic was applied to a set of three challenging parameter estimation problems of nonlinear dynamic biological systems, outperforming very significantly all the methods previously used for these benchmark problems.},

abstract = {Mammalian circadian rhythms are controlled by endogenous biological oscillators, including a master clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Since the period of this oscillation is of approximately 24 h, to keep synchrony with the environment, circadian rhythms need to be entrained daily by means of Zeitgeber ("time giver") signals, such as the light-dark cycle. Recent advances in the neurophysiology and molecular biology of circadian rhythmicity allow a better understanding of synchronization. In this review we cover several aspects of the mechanisms for photic entrainment of mammalian circadian rhythms, including retinal sensitivity to light by means of novel photopigments as well as circadian variations in the retina that contribute to the regulation of retinal physiology. Downstream from the retina, we examine retinohypothalamic communication through neurotransmitter (glutamate, aspartate, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) interaction with SCN receptors and the resulting signal transduction pathways in suprachiasmatic neurons, as well as putative neuron-glia interactions. Finally, we describe and analyze clock gene expression and its importance in entrainment mechanisms, as well as circadian disorders or retinal diseases related to entrainment deficits, including experimental and clinical treatments.},

The mouse PERIOD proteins (mPER1 and mPER2), CLOCK, and BMAL1 undergo robust circadian changes in phosphorylation. These proteins, the cryptochromes (mCRY1 and mCRY2), and casein kinase I epsilon (CKIepsilon) form multimeric complexes that are bound to DNA during negative transcriptional feedback. CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers remain bound to DNA over the circadian cycle. The temporal increase in mPER abundance controls the negative feedback interactions. Analysis of clock proteins in mCRY-deficient mice shows that the mCRYs are necessary for stabilizing phosphorylated mPER2 and for the nuclear accumulation of mPER1, mPER2, and CKIepsilon. We also provide in vivo evidence that casein kinase I delta is a second clock relevant kinase.},

Additionally, using structure-based drug design, we have been able to exploit differences in the hinge region between CK1$\delta$ and p38 to find selective inhibitors that have minimal p38 activity. The SAR, brain exposure, and the effect of these inhibitors on mouse circadian rhythms are described.

Here we describe the identification of potent synthetic REV-ERB agonists with in vivo activity. Administration of synthetic REV-ERB ligands alters circadian behaviour and the circadian pattern of core clock gene expression in the hypothalami of mice. The circadian pattern of expression of an array of metabolic genes in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was also altered, resulting in increased energy expenditure. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice with a REV-ERB agonist decreased obesity by reducing fat mass and markedly improving dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. These results indicate that synthetic REV-ERB ligands that pharmacologically target the circadian rhythm may be beneficial in the treatment of sleep disorders as well as metabolic diseases.},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks coordinate an organism's activities and regulate metabolic homeostasis in relation to daily environmental changes, most notably light/dark cycles. As in other organisms, the timekeeping mechanism in mammals depends on a self-sustaining transcriptional negative feedback loop with a built-in time delay in feedback inhibition. Although the time delay is essential for generating a slow, self-sustaining negative feedback loop with a period close to 24 hr, the exact mechanisms underlying the time delay are not known.

RESULTS: Here, we show that RNAi mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) is an essential mechanism in generating the time delay. In Dicer-deficient (and thus miRNA-deficient) cells and mice, circadian rhythms were dramatically shortened (by ∼2 hr), although the rhythms remained robust. The period shortening was caused by faster PER1 and PER2 translation in the Dicer-deficient cells. We also identified three specific miRNAs that regulate Per expression and showed that knockdown of these miRNAs in wild-type cells also shortened the circadian period.

CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the canonical function of miRNAs as translational modulators of target genes and their widespread roles in cell physiology, circadian rhythms are also modulated by miRNA-mediated RNAi acting on posttranscriptional regulation of key clock genes. Our present study definitively shows that RNAi is an important modulator of circadian rhythms by controlling the pace of PER synthesis and presents a novel layer of regulation for the clock.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian clock proteins undergo a daily cycle of accumulation followed by phosphorylation and degradation. The mechanism by which clock proteins undergo degradation has not been fully understood. Circadian clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) is shown to be the potential target of F-box protein beta-TrCP1, a component of ubiquitin E3 ligase. Here, we show that beta-TrCP2 as well as beta-TrCP1 target PER2 protein in vitro. We also identified beta-TrCP binding site (m2) of PER2 being recognized by both beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2. Luciferase-PER2 fusion system revealed that m2 site was responsible for the stability of PER2. The role of beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2 in circadian rhythm generation was analysed by real-time reporter assay revealing that siRNA-mediated suppressions of beta-TrCP1 and/or beta-TrCP2 attenuate circadian oscillations in NIH3T3 cell. beta-TrCP1-deficient mice, however, showed normal period length, light-induced phase-shift response in behaviour and normal expression of PER2, suggesting that beta-TrCP1 is dispensable for the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Our study indicates that beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2 were involved in the cell autonomous circadian rhythm generation in culture cells, although the role of beta-TrCP2 in the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus remains to be elucidated.},

A novel mechanistic model of postreceptor events including phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequent activation of downstream kinases Akt and protein kinase C-zeta is coupled with previously validated subsystem models of insulin receptor binding, receptor recycling, and GLUT4 translocation. A system of differential equations is defined by the structure of the model. Rate constants and model parameters are constrained by published experimental data. Model simulations of insulin dose-response experiments agree with published experimental data and also generate expected qualitative behaviors such as sequential signal amplification and increased sensitivity of downstream components. We examined the consequences of incorporating feedback pathways as well as representing pathological conditions, such as increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphatases, to illustrate the utility of our model for exploring molecular mechanisms. We conclude that mathematical modeling of signal transduction pathways is a useful approach for gaining insight into the complexities of metabolic insulin signaling.},

Unfortunately, in all but a few simple cases, analytical characterization of the statistical behavior of the proposed HMM is not possible. Moreover, analysis by Monte Carlo simulation is computationally cumbersome. We discuss several techniques for approximating the HMM by one that is more tractable. We employ simulations, based on a biologically relevant transcriptional regulatory system, to show the relative merits and limitations of various approximation techniques and provide general guidelines for their use.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain that synchronizes countless subsidiary oscillators in peripheral tissues. The rhythm-generating mechanism is thought to rely on a feedback loop involving positively and negatively acting transcription factors. BMAL1 and CLOCK activate the expression of Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes, and once PER and CRY proteins accumulate to a critical level they form complexes with BMAL1-CLOCK heterodimers and thereby repress the transcription of their own genes. Here, we show that SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, is required for high-magnitude circadian transcription of several core clock genes, including Bmal1, Rorgamma, Per2, and Cry1. SIRT1 binds CLOCK-BMAL1 in a circadian manner and promotes the deacetylation and degradation of PER2. Given the NAD(+) dependence of SIRT1 deacetylase activity, it is likely that SIRT1 connects cellular metabolism to the circadian core clockwork circuitry.},

The first part concentrates on statistics on the circle. Topics covered include tests of uniformity, tests of good-of-fit, inference on von Mises distributions and non-parametric methods. The second part considers statistics on spheres of arbitrary dimension, and includes a detailed account of inference on the main distributions on spheres. Recent material on correlation, regression time series, robust techniques, bootstrap methods, density estimation and curve fitting is presented. The third part considers statistics on more general sample spaces, in particular rotation groups, Stiefel manifolds, Grassmann manifolds and complex projective spaces. Shape analysis is considered from the perspective of directional statistics.Written by leading authors in the field, this text will be invaluable not only to researchers in probability and statistics interested in the latest developments in directional statistics, but also to practitioners and researchers in many scientific fields, including astronomy, biology, computer vision, earth sciences and image analysis.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks generate 24-h rhythms that are entrained by the day/night cycle. Clock circuits include several light inputs and interlocked feedback loops, with complex dynamics. Multiple biological components can contribute to each part of the circuit in higher organisms. Mechanistic models with morning, evening and central feedback loops have provided a heuristic framework for the clock in plants, but were based on transcriptional control. Here, we model observed, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation and constrain many parameter values based on experimental data. The model's feedback circuit is revised and now includes PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) and ZEITLUPE. The revised model matches data in varying environments and mutants, and gains robustness to parameter variation. Our results suggest that the activation of important morning-expressed genes follows their release from a night inhibitor (NI). Experiments inspired by the new model support the predicted NI function and show that the PRR5 gene contributes to the NI. The multiple PRR genes of Arabidopsis uncouple events in the late night from light-driven responses in the day, increasing the flexibility of rhythmic regulation.},

@article{St.John2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dynamics of gene regulation play a crucial role in a cellular control: allowing the cell to express the right proteins to meet changing needs. Some needs, such as correctly anticipating the day-night cycle, require complicated oscillatory features. In the analysis of gene regulatory networks, mathematical models are frequently used to understand how a network's structure enables it to respond appropriately to external inputs. These models typically consist of a set of ordinary differential equations, describing a network of biochemical reactions, and unknow kinetic parameters, chosen such that the model best captures experimental data. However, since a model's parameter values are uncertain, and since dynamic responses to inputs are highly parameter-dependent, it is difficult to assess the confidence associated with these in silico predictions. In particular, models with complex dynamics - such as oscillations - must be fit with computationally expensive global optimization routines, and cannot take advantage of existing measures of identifiability. Despite their difficulty to model mathematically, limit cycle oscillations play a key role in many biological processes, including cell cycling, metabolism, neuron firing, and circadian rhythms. RESULTS: In this study, we employ an efficient parameter estimation technique to enable a bootstrap uncertainty analysis for limit cycle models. Since the primary role of systems biology models is the insight they provide on responses to rate perturbations, we extend our uncertainty analysis to include first order sensitivity coefficients. Using a literature model of circadian rhythms, we show how predictive precision is degraded with decreasing sample points and increasing relative error. Additionally, we show how this method can be used for model discrimination by comparing the output identifiability of two candidate model structures to published literature data. CONCLUSIONS: Our method permits modellers of oscillatory systems to confidently show that a model's dynamic characteristics follow directly from experimental data and model structure, relaxing assumptions on the particular parameters chosen. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of continued collection of high-resolution data on gene and protein activity levels, as they allow the development of predictive mathematical models.},

abstract = {The mammalian clock regulates major aspects of energy metabolism, including glucose and lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The biochemical basis for coordinated control of the circadian clock and diverse metabolic pathways is not well understood. Here we show that PGC-1alpha (Ppargc1a), a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism, is rhythmically expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle of mice. PGC-1alpha stimulates the expression of clock genes, notably Bmal1 (Arntl) and Rev-erbalpha (Nr1d1), through coactivation of the ROR family of orphan nuclear receptors. Mice lacking PGC-1alpha show abnormal diurnal rhythms of activity, body temperature and metabolic rate. The disruption of physiological rhythms in these animals is correlated with aberrant expression of clock genes and those involved in energy metabolism. Analyses of PGC-1alpha-deficient fibroblasts and mice with liver-specific knockdown of PGC-1alpha indicate that it is required for cell-autonomous clock function. We have thus identified PGC-1alpha as a key component of the circadian oscillator that integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism.},

This suggested cryptochrome involvement in the negative limb of the feedback loop. Indeed, mCry1 and mCry2 RNA levels are reduced in the central and peripheral clocks of Clock/Clock mutant mice. mCRY1 and mCRY2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the mPER proteins, translocate each mPER protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock. Luciferase reporter gene assays show that mCRY1 or mCRY2 alone abrogates CLOCK:BMAL1-E box-mediated transcription.

abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

@article{Meireles-Filho2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Broadly expressed transcriptions factors (TFs) control tissue-specific programs of gene expression through interactions with local TF networks. A prime example is the circadian clock: although the conserved TFs CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) control a transcriptional circuit throughout animal bodies, rhythms in behavior and physiology are generated tissue specifically. Yet, how CLK and CYC determine tissue-specific clock programs has remained unclear.

RESULTS: Here, we use a functional genomics approach to determine the cis-regulatory requirements for clock specificity. We first determine CLK and CYC genome-wide binding targets in heads and bodies by ChIP-seq and show that they have distinct DNA targets in the two tissue contexts. Computational dissection of CLK/CYC context-specific binding sites reveals sequence motifs for putative partner factors, which are predictive for individual binding sites. Among them, we show that the opa and GATA motifs, differentially enriched in head and body binding sites respectively, can be bound by OPA and SERPENT (SRP). They act synergistically with CLK/CYC in the Drosophila feedback loop, suggesting that they help to determine their direct targets and therefore orchestrate tissue-specific clock outputs. In addition, using in vivo transgenic assays, we validate that GATA motifs are required for proper tissue-specific gene expression in the adult fat body, midgut, and Malpighian tubules, revealing a cis-regulatory signature for enhancers of the peripheral circadian clock.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal how universal clock circuits can regulate tissue-specific rhythms and, more generally, provide insights into the mechanism by which universal TFs can be modulated to drive tissue-specific programs of gene expression.},

Mutation of the cytoskeletal protein ParA specifically disrupted carboxysome order, promoted random carboxysome segregation during cell division, and impaired carbon fixation after disparate partitioning.

These data demonstrate that CRY-mediated repression of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex activity is required for maintenance of circadian rhythmicity and provide formal proof that transcriptional feedback is required for mammalian clock function.},

abstract = {A convenient way to estimate internal body time (BT) is essential for chronotherapy and time-restricted feeding, both of which use body-time information to maximize potency and minimize toxicity during drug administration and feeding, respectively. Previously, we proposed a molecular timetable based on circadian-oscillating substances in multiple mouse organs or blood to estimate internal body time from samples taken at only a few time points. Here we applied this molecular-timetable concept to estimate and evaluate internal body time in humans. We constructed a 1.5-d reference timetable of oscillating metabolites in human blood samples with 2-h sampling frequency while simultaneously controlling for the confounding effects of activity level, light, temperature, sleep, and food intake. By using this metabolite timetable as a reference, we accurately determined internal body time within 3 h from just two anti-phase blood samples. Our minimally invasive, molecular-timetable method with human blood enables highly optimized and personalized medicine.},

There is, in fact, a great deal of subtlety in the relationship between the structure of a reaction network and its capacity to engender bistability. In common physicochemical settings, large classes of extremely complex networks, taken with mass action kinetics, cannot give rise to bistability no matter what values the rate constants take. On the other hand, bistable behavior can be induced in those same settings by certain very simple and classical mass action mechanisms for enzyme catalysis of a single overall reaction. We present a theorem that distinguishes between those mass action networks that might support bistable behavior and those that cannot. Moreover, we indicate how switch-like behavior results from a well-studied mechanism for the action of human dihydrofolate reductase, an important anti-cancer target.},

abstract = {An MR image-based computational model of a murine KHT sarcoma is presented that allows the calculation of plasma fluid and solute transport within tissue. Such image-based models of solid tumors may be used to optimize patient-specific therapies. This model incorporates heterogeneous vasculature and tissue porosity to account for nonuniform perfusion of an MR-visible tracer, gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was conducted following intravenous infusion of Gd-DTPA to provide 1 h of tracer-concentration distribution data within tissue. Early time points (19 min) were used to construct 3D K (trans) and porosity maps using a two-compartment model; tracer transport was predicted at later time points using a 3D porous media model. Model development involved selecting an arterial input function (AIF) and conducting a sensitivity analysis of model parameters (tissue, vascular, and initial estimation of solute concentration in plasma) to investigate the effects on transport for a specific tumor. The developed model was then used to predict transport in two additional tumors. The sensitivity analysis suggests that plasma fluid transport is more sensitive to parameter changes than solute transport due to the dominance of transvascular exchange. Gd-DTPA distribution was similar to experimental patterns, but differences in Gd-DTPA magnitude at later time points may result from inaccurate selection of AIF. Thus, accurate AIF estimation is important for later time point prediction of low molecular weight tracer or drug transport in smaller tumors.},

abstract = {Circadian molecular oscillation is generated by a transcription/translation-based feedback loop in which CRY proteins play critical roles as potent inhibitors for E-box-dependent clock gene expression. Although CRY2 undergoes rhythmic phosphorylation in its C-terminal tail, structurally distinct from the CRY1 tail, little is understood about how protein kinase(s) controls the CRY2-specific phosphorylation and contributes to the molecular clockwork. Here we found that Ser557 in the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated by DYRK1A as a priming kinase for subsequent GSK-3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser553, which leads to proteasomal degradation of CRY2. In the mouse liver, DYRK1A kinase activity toward Ser557 of CRY2 showed circadian variation, with its peak in the accumulating phase of CRY2 protein. Knockdown of Dyrk1a caused abnormal accumulation of cytosolic CRY2, advancing the timing of a nuclear increase of CRY2, and shortened the period length of the cellular circadian rhythm. Expression of an S557A/S553A mutant of CRY2 phenocopied the effect of Dyrk1a knockdown in terms of the circadian period length of the cellular clock. DYRK1A is a novel clock component cooperating with GSK-3beta and governs the Ser557 phosphorylation-triggered degradation of CRY2.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence suggests that the time of day at which calories are consumed markedly impacts body weight gain and adiposity. However, a precise quantification of energy balance parameters during controlled animal studies enforcing time-of-day-restricted feeding is currently lacking in the absence of direct human interaction.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was therefore to quantify the effects of restricted feeding during the light (sleep)-phase in a fully-automated, computer-controlled comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system (CLAMS) designed to modulate food access in a time-of-day-dependent manner. Energy balance, gene expression (within metabolically relevant tissues), humoral factors and body weight were assessed.

RESULTS: We report that relative to mice fed only during the dark (active)-phase, light (sleep)-phase fed mice: (1) consume a large meal upon initiation of food availability; (2) consume greater total calories per day; (3) exhibit a higher respiratory exchange ratio (indicative of decreased reliance on lipid/fatty acid oxidation); (4) exhibit tissue-specific alterations in the phases and amplitudes of circadian clock and metabolic genes in metabolically active tissues (greatest phase differences observed in the liver and diminution of amplitudes in epididymal fat, gastrocnemius muscle and heart); (5) exhibit diminished amplitude in humoral factor diurnal variations (for example, corticosterone); and (6) exhibit greater weight gain within 9 days of restricted feeding.

CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data suggest that weight gain following light (sleep)-phase restricted feeding is associated with significant alterations in energy balance, as well as dyssynchrony between metabolically active organs.},

We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

Here, we determine how these two independent signals affect circadian timekeeping from the molecular to the behavioral level. By developing a systems pharmacology model, we predict and experimentally validate that chronic CK1$\delta$/$\epsilon$ inhibition during the earlier hours of a LD cycle can produce a constant stable delay of rhythm. However, chronic dosing later during the day, or in the presence of longer light intervals, is not predicted to yield an entrained rhythm. We also propose a simple method based on phase response curves (PRCs) that predicts the effects of a LD cycle and chronic dosing of a circadian drug. This work indicates that dosing timing and environmental signals must be carefully considered for accurate pharmacological manipulation of circadian phase.CPT: Pharmacometrics \& Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e57; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.34; published online 17 July 2013.},

GSK-3 activity is inhibited through phosphorylation of serine 21 in GSK-3 alpha and serine 9 in GSK-3 beta. These serine residues of GSK-3 have been previously identified as targets of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a serine/threonine kinase located downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Here, we show that serine 21 in GSK-3 alpha and serine 9 in GSK-3 beta are also physiological substrates of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Protein kinase A physically associates with, phosphorylates, and inactivates both isoforms of GSK-3. The results indicate that depending on the stimulatory context, the activity of GSK-3 can be modulated either by growth factors that work through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B cascade or by hormonal stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors that link to changes in intracellular cAMP levels.},

Although DNA microarrays have been widely used to understand the critical events underlying growth, development, homeostasis, behavior and the onset of disease, the management of the resulting data has received little attention. Presently, the fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5 are most often used to prepare labeled cDNA for microarray hybridizations. Raw microarray data are image files that have to be transformed into gene expression formats--a process that requires data manipulation due to systematic variations which may be attributed to differences in the physical and chemical dye applications is to identify differences in transcript levels calculated from fluorescence ratios it is necessary to normalize fluorescence signals to compensate for systematic variations. Here, we will review current normalization strategies applied to cDNA microarrays and discuss their limits. We will show that experimental design determines normalization success.},

abstract = {In metabolic networks, metabolites are usually present in great excess over the enzymes that catalyze their interconversion, and describing the rates of these reactions by using the Michaelis-Menten rate law is perfectly valid. This rate law assumes that the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex (C) is much less than the free substrate concentration (S0). However, in protein interaction networks, the enzymes and substrates are all proteins in comparable concentrations, and neglecting C with respect to S0 is not valid. Borghans, DeBoer, and Segel developed an alternative description of enzyme kinetics that is valid when C is comparable to S0. We extend this description, which Borghans et al. call the total quasi-steady state approximation, to networks of coupled enzymatic reactions. First, we analyze an isolated Goldbeter-Koshland switch when enzymes and substrates are present in comparable concentrations. Then, on the basis of a real example of the molecular network governing cell cycle progression, we couple two and three Goldbeter-Koshland switches together to study the effects of feedback in networks of protein kinases and phosphatases. Our analysis shows that the total quasi-steady state approximation provides an excellent kinetic formalism for protein interaction networks, because (1) it unveils the modular structure of the enzymatic reactions, (2) it suggests a simple algorithm to formulate correct kinetic equations, and (3) contrary to classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, it succeeds in faithfully reproducing the dynamics of the network both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

We describe known interface paradigms for inputing models of intracellular regulatory networks: graphical layout (diagrams), wizards, scripting languages, and direct entry of chemical equations. We present the JigCell Model Builder, which allows users to define models as a set of reaction equations using a spreadsheet (an example of direct entry of equations) and outputs model definitions in the Systems Biology Markup Language, Level 2. We present the results of two usability studies. The spreadsheet paradigm demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing the number of errors made by modelers when compared to hand conversion of a wiring diagram to differential equations. A comparison of representatives of the four interface paradigms for a simple model of the cell cycle was conducted which measured time, mouse clicks, and keystrokes to enter the model, and the number of screens needed to view the contents of the model. All four paradigms had similar data entry times. The spreadsheet and scripting language approaches require significantly fewer screens to view the models than do the wizard or graphical layout approaches.},

@article{Thomas2013,
abstract = {A class of theoretical models seeks to explain rhythmic single cell data by postulating that they are generated by intrinsic noise in biochemical systems whose deterministic models exhibit only damped oscillations. The main features of such noise-induced oscillations are quantified by the power spectrum which measures the dependence of the oscillatory signal's power with frequency. In this paper we derive an approximate closed-form expression for the power spectrum of any monostable biochemical system close to a Hopf bifurcation, where noise-induced oscillations are most pronounced. Unlike the commonly used linear noise approximation which is valid in the macroscopic limit of large volumes, our theory is valid over a wide range of volumes and hence affords a more suitable description of single cell noise-induced oscillations. Our theory predicts that the spectra have three universal features: (i) a dominant peak at some frequency, (ii) a smaller peak at twice the frequency of the dominant peak and (iii) a peak at zero frequency. Of these, the linear noise approximation predicts only the first feature while the remaining two stem from the combination of intrinsic noise and nonlinearity in the law of mass action. The theoretical expressions are shown to accurately match the power spectra determined from stochastic simulations of mitotic and circadian oscillators. Furthermore it is shown how recently acquired single cell rhythmic fibroblast data displays all the features predicted by our theory and that the experimental spectrum is well described by our theory but not by the conventional linear noise approximation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Ramanathan2012,
abstract = {In mammals, many aspects of behavior and physiology such as sleep-wake cycles and liver metabolism are regulated by endogenous circadian clocks (reviewed). The circadian time-keeping system is a hierarchical multi-oscillator network, with the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizing and coordinating extra-SCN and peripheral clocks elsewhere. Individual cells are the functional units for generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms, and these oscillators of different tissue types in the organism share a remarkably similar biochemical negative feedback mechanism. However, due to interactions at the neuronal network level in the SCN and through rhythmic, systemic cues at the organismal level, circadian rhythms at the organismal level are not necessarily cell-autonomous. Compared to traditional studies of locomotor activity in vivo and SCN explants ex vivo, cell-based in vitro assays allow for discovery of cell-autonomous circadian defects. Strategically, cell-based models are more experimentally tractable for phenotypic characterization and rapid discovery of basic clock mechanisms. Because circadian rhythms are dynamic, longitudinal measurements with high temporal resolution are needed to assess clock function. In recent years, real-time bioluminescence recording using firefly luciferase as a reporter has become a common technique for studying circadian rhythms in mammals, as it allows for examination of the persistence and dynamics of molecular rhythms. To monitor cell-autonomous circadian rhythms of gene expression, luciferase reporters can be introduced into cells via transient transfection or stable transduction. Here we describe a stable transduction protocol using lentivirus-mediated gene delivery. The lentiviral vector system is superior to traditional methods such as transient transfection and germline transmission because of its efficiency and versatility: it permits efficient delivery and stable integration into the host genome of both dividing and non-dividing cells. Once a reporter cell line is established, the dynamics of clock function can be examined through bioluminescence recording. We first describe the generation of P(Per2)-dLuc reporter lines, and then present data from this and other circadian reporters. In these assays, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and U2OS human osteosarcoma cells are used as cellular models. We also discuss various ways of using these clock models in circadian studies. Methods described here can be applied to a great variety of cell types to study the cellular and molecular basis of circadian clocks, and may prove useful in tackling problems in other biological systems.},

abstract = {Reliable detection of circadian phase in humans using noninvasive ambulatory measurements in real-life conditions is challenging and still an unsolved problem. The masking effects of everyday behavior and environmental input such as physical activity and light on the measured variables need to be considered critically. Here, we aimed at developing techniques for estimating circadian phase with the lowest subject burden possible, that is, without the need of constant routine (CR) laboratory conditions or without measuring the standard circadian markers, (rectal) core body temperature (CBT), and melatonin levels. In this validation study, subjects (N = 16) wore multi-channel ambulatory monitoring devices and went about their daily routine for 1 week. The devices measured a large number of physiological, behavioral, and environmental variables, including CBT, skin temperatures, cardiovascular and respiratory function, movement/posture, ambient temperature, and the spectral composition and intensity of light received at eye level. Sleep diaries were logged electronically. After the ambulatory phase, subjects underwent a 32-h CR procedure in the laboratory for measuring unmasked circadian phase based on the "midpoint" of the salivary melatonin profile. To overcome the complex masking effects of confounding variables during ambulatory measurements, multiple regression techniques were applied in combination with the cross-validation approach to subject-independent prediction of circadian phase. The most accurate estimate of circadian phase was achieved using skin temperatures, irradiance for ambient light in the blue spectral band, and motion acceleration as predictors with lags of up to 24 h. Multiple regression showed statistically significant improvement of variance of prediction error over the traditional approaches to determining circadian phase based on single predictors (motion acceleration or sleep log), although CBT was intentionally not included as the predictor. Compared to CBT alone, our method resulted in a 40\% smaller range of prediction errors and a nonsignificant reduction of error variance. The proposed noninvasive measurement method could find applications in sleep medicine or in other domains where knowing the exact endogenous circadian phase is important (e.g., for the timing of light therapy).},

abstract = {Using a forward genetics ENU mutagenesis screen for recessive mutations that affect circadian rhythmicity in the mouse, we isolated a long period (approximately 26 hr) circadian mutant named Overtime (Ovtm). Positional cloning and genetic complementation reveal that Ovtm is encoded by the F-box protein FBXL3, a component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box-protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The Ovtm mutation causes an isoleucine to threonine (I364T) substitution leading to a loss of function in FBXL3, which interacts specifically with the CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) proteins. In Ovtm mice, expression of the PERIOD proteins PER1 and PER2 is reduced; however, the CRY proteins CRY1 and CRY2 are unchanged. The loss of FBXL3 function leads to a stabilization of the CRY proteins, which in turn leads to a global transcriptional repression of the Per and Cry genes. Thus, Fbxl3(Ovtm) defines a molecular link between CRY turnover and CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent circadian transcription to modulate circadian period.},

abstract = {Advancing or delaying the light-dark (LD) cycle perturbs the circadian clock, which eventually recovers its original phase with respect to the new LD cycle. Readjustment of the clock occurs by shifting its phase in the same (orthodromic re-entrainment) or opposite direction (antidromic re-entrainment) as the shift in the LD cycle. To investigate circadian clock recovery after phase shifts of the LD cycle we use a detailed computational model previously proposed for the cellular regulatory network underlying the mammalian circadian clock. The model predicts the existence of a sharp threshold separating orthodromic from antidromic re-entrainment. In the vicinity of this threshold, resynchronization of the clock after a phase shift markedly slows down. The type of re-entrainment, the position of the threshold and the time required for resynchronization depend on multiple factors such as the autonomous period of the clock, the direction and magnitude of the phase shift, the clock biochemical kinetic parameters, and light intensity. Partitioning the phase shift into a series of smaller phases shifts decreases the impact on the recovery of the circadian clock. We use the phase response curve to predict the location of the threshold separating orthodromic and antidromic re-entrainment after advanced or delayed phase shifts of the LD cycle. The marked increase in recovery times predicted near the threshold could be responsible for the most severe disturbances of the human circadian clock associated with jet lag.},

Cell independence, cell-cell communication and stochastic cell response are integral parts of the model. The model simulations incorporate probabilities of an individual cell to transition into one of four stages--quiescence, proliferation, migration and apoptosis. We demonstrate that several features, such as continuous sprouts, cell clustering and branching, that are observed in microfluidic experiments conducted under controlled conditions using few angiogenic factors can be reproduced by this model. We also identify the transition probabilities that result in specific sprout characteristics such as long continuous sprouts and specific branching patterns. Thus, this model can be used to cluster sprout morphology as a function of various influencing factors.},

abstract = {The mammalian biological clock, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), imposes its temporal structure on the organism via neural and endocrine outputs. To further investigate SCN control of the autonomic nervous system we focused in the present study on the daily rhythm in plasma glucose concentrations. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is an important target area of biological clock output and harbors the pre-autonomic neurons that control peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Using local administration of GABA and glutamate receptor (ant)agonists in the PVN at different times of the light/dark-cycle we investigated whether daily changes in the activity of autonomic nervous system contribute to the control of plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations. Activation of neuronal activity in the PVN of non-feeding animals, either by administering a glutamatergic agonist or a GABAergic antagonist, induced hyperglycemia. The effect of the GABA-antagonist was time dependent, causing increased plasma glucose concentrations only when administered during the light period. The absence of a hyperglycemic effect of the GABA-antagonist in SCN-ablated animals provided further evidence for a daily change in GABAergic input from the SCN to the PVN. On the other hand, feeding-induced plasma glucose and insulin responses were suppressed by inhibition of PVN neuronal activity only during the dark period. These results indicate that the pre-autonomic neurons in the PVN are controlled by an interplay of inhibitory and excitatory inputs. Liver-dedicated sympathetic pre-autonomic neurons (responsible for hepatic glucose production) and pancreas-dedicated pre-autonomic parasympathetic neurons (responsible for insulin release) are controlled by inhibitory GABAergic contacts that are mainly active during the light period. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic pre-autonomic PVN neurons also receive excitatory inputs, either from the biological clock (sympathetic pre-autonomic neurons) or from non-clock areas (para-sympathetic pre-autonomic neurons), but the timing information is mainly provided by the GABAergic outputs of the biological clock.},

abstract = {The biochemistry, physiology and behavior of nearly all organisms are influenced by an inherent circadian (24 hr) clock timing mechanism. For mammals, the linchpin of this biological timing process is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. One key feature of the SCN clock is that it is tightly entrained to lighting cues, thus ensuring that the clock is synchronized to the ever-changing seasonal light cycle. Within the field of circadian biology, there has been intense interest in understanding the intracellular signaling events that drive this process. To this end, our recent studies have revealed a role for an evolutionarily conserved translational control kinase, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in the SCN clock entrainment process. Here we provide an overview of mechanisms of inducible mTOR activation in the SCN, and describe the effects of mTOR on clock protein synthesis and behavioral rhythmicity. Given that dysregulation of SCN timing has been associated with an array of clinical conditions (e.g., hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression), new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate clock timing may provide new therapeutic treatments for circadian rhythm-associated disorders.},

abstract = {Experimental data on the circadian (approximately 24-h) clock in mammalian cells are vast, diverse, and detailed. Mathematical models are therefore needed to piece these data together and to study overall clock behavior. Previous models have focused on Neurospora or Drosophila or can be converted to a Drosophila model simply by renaming variables. Those models used Hill-type terms for transcription regulation and Michaelis-Menten type or delay terms for posttranslation regulation. Recent mammalian experimental data call into question some of the assumptions in these approaches. Moreover, gene duplication has led to more proteins in the mammalian system than in lower organisms. Here we develop a detailed distinctly mammalian model by using mass action kinetics. Parameters for our model are found from experimental data by using a coordinate search method. The model accurately predicts the phase of entrainment, amplitude of oscillation, and shape of time profiles of clock mRNAs and proteins and is also robust to parameter changes and mutations.},

In recent years, molecular genetic techniques have revealed a complex network of clock components in Arabidopsis. To gain insight into the dynamics of these interactions, new components need to be integrated into the mathematical model of the plant clock. Our approach accelerates the iterative process of model identification, to incorporate new components, and to systematically test different proposed structural hypotheses. Recent studies indicate that the pseudo-response regulators PRR7 and PRR9 play a key role in the core clock of Arabidopsis. We incorporate PRR7 and PRR9 into an existing model involving the transcription factors TIMING OF CAB (TOC1), LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED (CCA1). We propose candidate models based on experimental hypotheses and identify the computational models with the application of an optimization routine. Validation is accomplished through systematic analysis of various mutant phenotypes. We introduce and apply sensitivity analysis as a novel tool for analyzing and distinguishing the characteristics of proposed architectures, which also allows for further validation of the hypothesized structures.},

abstract = {With the rising application of systems biology, sensitivity analysis methods have been widely applied to study the biological systems, including metabolic networks, signalling pathways and genetic circuits. Sensitivity analysis can provide valuable insights about how robust the biological responses are with respect to the changes of biological parameters and which model inputs are the key factors that affect the model outputs. In addition, sensitivity analysis is valuable for guiding experimental analysis, model reduction and parameter estimation. Local and global sensitivity analysis approaches are the two types of sensitivity analysis that are commonly applied in systems biology. Local sensitivity analysis is a classic method that studies the impact of small perturbations on the model outputs. On the other hand, global sensitivity analysis approaches have been applied to understand how the model outputs are affected by large variations of the model input parameters. In this review, the author introduces the basic concepts of sensitivity analysis approaches applied to systems biology models. Moreover, the author discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different sensitivity analysis methods, how to choose a proper sensitivity analysis approach, the available sensitivity analysis tools for systems biology models and the caveats in the interpretation of sensitivity analysis results.},

abstract = {Circadian (nearly 24-h) clocks are remarkably accurate at timing biological events despite the randomness of their biochemical reactions. Here we examine the causes of their immunity to molecular noise in the context of a detailed stochastic mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock. This stochastic model is a direct generalization of the deterministic mammalian circadian clock model previously developed. A feature of that model is that it completely specifies all molecular reactions, leaving no ambiguity in the formulation of a stochastic version of the model. With parameters based on experimental data concerning clock protein concentrations within a cell, we find accurate circadian rhythms in our model only when promoter interaction occurs on the time scale of seconds. As the model is scaled up by proportionally increasing the numbers of molecules of all species and the reaction rates with the promoter, the observed variability scales as 1/n(0.5), where n is the number of molecules of any species. Our results show that gene duplication increases robustness by providing more promoters with which the transcription factors of the model can interact. Although PER2 mutants were not rhythmic in the deterministic version of this model, they are rhythmic in the stochastic version.},

They were then flown by their brave designers to see if the design would work--often with disastrous results. Today, airplanes, helicopters, missiles, and rockets are designed in computers in a process that involves iterating through enormous numbers of designs before anything is made. Until very recently, novel drug-like molecules were nearly always made first like early airplanes, then tested to see if they were any good (although usually not on the brave scientists who created them!). The resulting extremely high failure rate is legendary. This article describes some of the evolution of computer-based design in the aerospace industry and compares it with the progress made to date in computer-aided drug design. Software development for pharmaceutical research has been largely entrepreneurial, with only relatively limited support from government and industry end-user organizations. The pharmaceutical industry is still about 30 years behind aerospace and other industries in fully recognizing the value of simulation and modeling and funding the development of the tools needed to catch up.},

@article{Liu2008,
abstract = {The mammalian circadian clockwork is composed of a core PER/CRY feedback loop and additional interlocking loops. In particular, the ROR/REV/Bmal1 loop, consisting of ROR activators and REV-ERB repressors that regulate Bmal1 expression, is thought to "stabilize" core clock function. However, due to functional redundancy and pleiotropic effects of gene deletions, the role of the ROR/REV/Bmal1 loop has not been accurately defined. In this study, we examined cell-autonomous circadian oscillations using combined gene knockout and RNA interference and demonstrated that REV-ERBalpha and beta are functionally redundant and are required for rhythmic Bmal1 expression. In contrast, the RORs contribute to Bmal1 amplitude but are dispensable for Bmal1 rhythm. We provide direct in vivo genetic evidence that the REV-ERBs also participate in combinatorial regulation of Cry1 and Rorc expression, leading to their phase-delay relative to Rev-erbalpha. Thus, the REV-ERBs play a more prominent role than the RORs in the basic clock mechanism. The cellular genetic approach permitted testing of the robustness of the intracellular core clock function. We showed that cells deficient in both REV-ERBalpha and beta function, or those expressing constitutive BMAL1, were still able to generate and maintain normal Per2 rhythmicity. Our findings thus underscore the resilience of the intracellular clock mechanism and provide important insights into the transcriptional topologies underlying the circadian clock. Since REV-ERB function and Bmal1 mRNA/protein cycling are not necessary for basic clock function, we propose that the major role of the ROR/REV/Bmal1 loop and its constituents is to control rhythmic transcription of clock output genes.},

abstract = {The circadian clocks keeping time in many living organisms rely on self-sustained biochemical oscillations entrained by external cues, such as light, to the 24-h cycle induced by Earth's rotation. However, environmental cues are unreliable due to the variability of habitats, weather conditions, or cue-sensing mechanisms among individuals. A tempting hypothesis is that circadian clocks have evolved so as to be robust to fluctuations in the signal that entrains them. To support this hypothesis, we analyze the synchronization behavior of weakly and periodically forced oscillators in terms of their phase response curve (PRC), which measures phase changes induced by a perturbation applied at different times of the cycle. We establish a general relationship between the robustness of key entrainment properties, such as stability and oscillator phase, on the one hand, and the shape of the PRC as characterized by a specific curvature or the existence of a dead zone, on the other hand. The criteria obtained are applied to computational models of circadian clocks and account for the disparate robustness properties of various forcing schemes. Finally, the analysis of PRCs measured experimentally in several organisms strongly suggests a case of convergent evolution toward an optimal strategy for maintaining a clock that is accurate and robust to environmental fluctuations.},

Under constant conditions of illumination and temperature, these internal biological rhythms persist with a period close to 1 day ("circadian"), but it is usually not exactly 24h. Recent discoveries have uncovered stunning similarities among the molecular circuitries of circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and bread molds. A consensus picture is coming into focus around two proteins (called PER and TIM in fruit flies), which dimerize and then inhibit transcription of their own genes. Although this picture seems to confirm a venerable model of circadian rhythms based on time-delayed negative feedback, we suggest that just as crucial to the circadian oscillator is a positive feedback loop based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization. These ideas can be expressed in simple mathematical form (phase plane portraits), and the model accounts naturally for several hallmarks of circadian rhythms, including temperature compensation and the per(L) mutant phenotype. In addition, the model suggests how an endogenous circadian oscillator could have evolved from a more primitive, light-activated switch.},

Through sensitivity analysis, we identify additional control targets whose individual and simultaneous manipulation (via a model predictive control algorithm) out-perform the open-loop light-based phase recovery dynamics by nearly 3-fold. We further demonstrate the robustness of phase resetting by synchronizing short- and long-period mutant phenotypes to the 24-hour environment; the control algorithm is robust in the presence of model mismatch. These studies prove the efficacy and immediate application of model predictive control in experimental studies and medicine.

As in other organisms, the timekeeping mechanism in mammals depends on a self-sustaining transcriptional negative feedback loop with a built-in time delay in feedback inhibition. Although the time delay is essential for generating a slow, self-sustaining negative feedback loop with a period close to 24 hr, the exact mechanisms underlying the time delay are not known.

RESULTS: Here, we show that RNAi mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) is an essential mechanism in generating the time delay. In Dicer-deficient (and thus miRNA-deficient) cells and mice, circadian rhythms were dramatically shortened (by ∼2 hr), although the rhythms remained robust. The period shortening was caused by faster PER1 and PER2 translation in the Dicer-deficient cells. We also identified three specific miRNAs that regulate Per expression and showed that knockdown of these miRNAs in wild-type cells also shortened the circadian period.

CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the canonical function of miRNAs as translational modulators of target genes and their widespread roles in cell physiology, circadian rhythms are also modulated by miRNA-mediated RNAi acting on posttranscriptional regulation of key clock genes. Our present study definitively shows that RNAi is an important modulator of circadian rhythms by controlling the pace of PER synthesis and presents a novel layer of regulation for the clock.},

@article{Chang2012,
abstract = {The oscillator of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria is composed of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a self-sustained ∼24-h rhythm of phosphorylation of KaiC. The mechanism propelling this oscillator has remained elusive, however. We show that stacking interactions between the CI and CII rings of KaiC drive the transition from the phosphorylation-specific KaiC-KaiA interaction to the dephosphorylation-specific KaiC-KaiB interaction. We have identified the KaiB-binding site, which is on the CI domain. This site is hidden when CI domains are associated as a hexameric ring. However, stacking of the CI and CII rings exposes the KaiB-binding site. Because the clock output protein SasA also binds to CI and competes with KaiB for binding, ring stacking likely regulates clock output. We demonstrate that ADP can expose the KaiB-binding site in the absence of ring stacking, providing an explanation for how it can reset the clock.},

@article{Thommen2010,
abstract = {The development of systemic approaches in biology has put emphasis on identifying genetic modules whose behavior can be modeled accurately so as to gain insight into their structure and function. However, most gene circuits in a cell are under control of external signals and thus, quantitative agreement between experimental data and a mathematical model is difficult. Circadian biology has been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal clock that orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle have been constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and mammals. In most cases, a complex architecture with interlocked feedback loops has been evidenced. Here we present the first modeling results for the circadian clock of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. Two plant-like clock genes have been shown to play a central role in the Ostreococcus clock. We find that their expression time profiles can be accurately reproduced by a minimal model of a two-gene transcriptional feedback loop. Remarkably, best adjustment of data recorded under light/dark alternation is obtained when assuming that the oscillator is not coupled to the diurnal cycle. This suggests that coupling to light is confined to specific time intervals and has no dynamical effect when the oscillator is entrained by the diurnal cycle. This intriguing property may reflect a strategy to minimize the impact of fluctuations in daylight intensity on the core circadian oscillator, a type of perturbation that has been rarely considered when assessing the robustness of circadian clocks.},

abstract = {The molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes. The role of chromatin remodeling in a physiological setting such as the circadian clock is yet unclear. We show that the protein CLOCK, a central component of the circadian pacemaker, has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. CLOCK shares homology with acetyl-coenzyme A binding motifs within the MYST family of HATs. CLOCK displays high sequence similarity to ACTR, a member of SRC family of HATs, with which it shares also enzymatic specificity for histones H3 and H4. BMAL1, the heterodimerization partner of CLOCK, enhances HAT function. The HAT activity of CLOCK is essential to rescue circadian rhythmicity and activation of clock genes in Clock mutant cells. Identification of CLOCK as a novel type of DNA binding HAT reveals that chromatin remodeling is crucial for the core clock mechanism and identifies unforeseen links between histone acetylation and cellular physiology.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms help organisms adapt to predictable daily changes in their environment. Light resets the phase of the underlying oscillator to maintain the organism in sync with its surroundings. Light also affects the amplitude of overt rhythms. At a critical phase during the night, when phase shifts are maximal, light can reduce rhythm amplitude to nearly zero, whereas in the subjective day, when phase shifts are minimal, it can boost amplitude substantially. To explore the cellular basis for this reciprocal relationship between phase shift and amplitude change, we generated a photoentrainable, cell-based system in mammalian fibroblasts that shares several key features of suprachiasmatic nucleus light entrainment. Upon light stimulation, these cells exhibit calcium/cyclic AMP responsive element-binding (CREB) protein phosphorylation, leading to temporally gated acute induction of the Per2 gene, followed by phase-dependent changes in phase and/or amplitude of the PER2 circadian rhythm. At phases near the PER2 peak, photic stimulation causes little phase shift but enhanced rhythm amplitude. At phases near the PER2 nadir, on the other hand, the same stimuli cause large phase shifts but dampen rhythm amplitude. Real-time monitoring of PER2 oscillations in single cells reveals that changes in both synchrony and amplitude of individual oscillators underlie these phenomena.},

A novel sensitivity analysis is developed to study the circadian entrainment in silico based on a limit cycle approach and applied to a model of Drosophila circadian rhythm. The comparative analyses of complete and skeleton photoperiods suggest a trade-off between the contribution of period modulation (parametric effect) and phase shift (nonparametric effect) in Drosophila circadian entrainment. The results also give suggestions for an experimental study to (in)validate the two models of entrainment.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms in cardiac function are apparent in e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, and acute adverse cardiac events. A circadian clock in heart tissue has been identified, but entrainment pathways of this clock are still unclear. We cultured tissues of mice carrying bioluminescence reporters of the core clock genes, period 1 or 2 (per1(luc) or PER2(LUC)) and compared in vitro responses of atrium to treatment with medium and a synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone [DEX]) to that of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver. We observed that PER2(LUC), but not per1(luc) is rhythmic in atrial tissue, while both per1(luc) and PER2(LUC) exhibit rhythmicity in other cultured tissues. In contrast to the SCN and liver, both per1(luc) and PER2(LUC) bioluminescence amplitudes were increased in response to DEX treatment, and the PER2(LUC) amplitude response was dependent on the time of treatment. Large phase-shift responses to both medium and DEX treatments were observed in the atrium, and phase responses to medium treatment were not attributed to serum content but the treatment procedure itself. The phase-response curves of atrium to both DEX and medium treatments were found to be different to the liver. Moreover, the time of day of the culturing procedure itself influenced the phase of the circadian clock in each of the cultured tissues, but the magnitude of this response was uniquely large in atrial tissue. The current data describe novel entrainment signals for the atrial circadian clock and specifically highlight entrainment by mechanical treatment, an intriguing observation considering the mechanical nature of cardiac tissue.},

In this study, three putative CK1 epsilon phosphorylation motif clusters in mouse Per1 (mPer1) were identified, and the phosphorylation status of serine and threonine residues in these clusters was examined. Phosphorylation of residues within a region defined by amino acids 653-663 and in particular of Ser-661 and Ser-663, was identified as responsible for the nuclear translocation of mPer1. Furthermore, phosphorylation of these residues may influence the nuclear translocation of a clock protein complex containing mPer1. These findings indicate that mPer1 phosphorylation is a critical aspect of the circadian clock mechanism.},

Here, we studied the direct contribution of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central pacemaker in the circadian system, in the development of insulin resistance. Exclusive bilateral SCN lesions in male C57Bl/6J mice, as verified by immunochemistry, showed a small but significant increase in body weight (+17\%), which was accounted for by an increase in fat mass. In contrast, mice with collateral damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus and paraventricular nucleus showed severe obesity and insulin resistance. Mice with exclusive SCN ablation revealed a loss of circadian rhythm in activity, oxygen consumption, and food intake. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis 8 weeks after lesioning showed that the glucose infusion rate was significantly lower in SCN lesioned mice compared with sham-operated mice (-63\%). Although insulin potently inhibited endogenous glucose production (-84\%), this was greatly reduced in SCN lesioned mice (-7\%), indicating severe hepatic insulin resistance. Our data show that SCN malfunctioning plays an important role in the disturbance of energy balance and suggest that an absence of central clock activity, in a genetically intact animal, may lead to the development of insulin resistance.},

abstract = {The circadian clock is a molecular and cellular oscillator found in most mammalian tissues that regulates rhythmic physiology and behavior. Numerous investigations have addressed the contribution of circadian rhythmicity to cellular, organ, and organismal physiology. We recently developed a method to look at transcriptional oscillations with unprecedented precision and accuracy using high-density time sampling. Here, we report a comparison of oscillating transcription from mouse liver, NIH3T3, and U2OS cells. Several surprising observations resulted from this study, including a 100-fold difference in the number of cycling transcripts in autonomous cellular models of the oscillator versus tissues harvested from intact mice. Strikingly, we found two clusters of genes that cycle at the second and third harmonic of circadian rhythmicity in liver, but not cultured cells. Validation experiments show that 12-hour oscillatory transcripts occur in several other peripheral tissues as well including heart, kidney, and lungs. These harmonics are lost ex vivo, as well as under restricted feeding conditions.

abstract = {Bioluminescence techniques allow accurate monitoring of the circadian clock in single cells. We have analyzed bioluminescence data of Per gene expression in mouse SCN neurons and fibroblasts. From these data, we extracted parameters such as damping rate and noise intensity using two simple mathematical models, one describing a damped oscillator driven by noise, and one describing a self-sustained noisy oscillator. Both models describe the data well and enabled us to quantitatively characterize both wild-type cells and several mutants. It has been suggested that the circadian clock is self-sustained at the single cell level, but we conclude that present data are not sufficient to determine whether the circadian clock of single SCN neurons and fibroblasts is a damped or a self-sustained oscillator. We show how to settle this question, however, by testing the models' predictions of different phases and amplitudes in response to a periodic entrainment signal (zeitgeber).},

abstract = {CLOCK is a positive component of a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop of the central circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals. To examine CLOCK-regulated circadian transcription in peripheral tissues, we performed microarray analyses using liver RNA isolated from Clock mutant mice. We also compared expression profiles with those of Cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) double knockout mice. We identified more than 100 genes that fluctuated from day to night and of which expression levels were decreased in Clock mutant mice. In Cry-deficient mice, the expression levels of most CLOCK-regulated genes were elevated to the upper range of normal oscillation. Most of the screened genes had a CLOCK/BMAL1 binding site (E box) in the 5'-flanking region. We found that CLOCK was absolutely concerned with the circadian transcription of one type of liver genes (such as DBP, TEF, and Usp2) and partially with another (such as mPer1, mPer2, mDec1, Nocturnin, P450 oxidoreductase, and FKBP51) because the latter were damped but remained rhythmic in the mutant mice. Our results showed that CLOCK and CRY proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of many circadian output genes in the mouse liver. In addition to being a core component of the negative feedback loop that drives the circadian oscillator, CLOCK also appears to be involved in various physiological functions such as cell cycle, lipid metabolism, immune functions, and proteolysis in peripheral tissues.},

Here, we reveal that a high-fat diet (HFD) generates a profound reorganization of specific metabolic pathways, leading to widespread remodeling of the liver clock. Strikingly, in addition to disrupting the normal circadian cycle, HFD causes an unexpectedly large-scale genesis of de novo oscillating transcripts, resulting in reorganization of the coordinated oscillations between coherent transcripts and metabolites. The mechanisms underlying this reprogramming involve both the impairment of CLOCK:BMAL1 chromatin recruitment and a pronounced cyclic activation of surrogate pathways through the transcriptional regulator PPAR$\gamma$. Finally, we demonstrate that it is specifically the nutritional challenge, and not the development of obesity, that causes the reprogramming of the clock and that the effects of the diet on the clock are reversible.},

@article{Maywood2011,
abstract = {Circadian pacemaking in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) revolves around a transcriptional/posttranslational feedback loop in which period (Per) and cryptochrome (Cry) genes are negatively regulated by their protein products. Genetically specified differences in this oscillator underlie sleep and metabolic disorders, and dictate diurnal/nocturnal preference. A critical goal, therefore, is to identify mechanisms that generate circadian phenotypic diversity, through both single gene effects and gene interactions. The individual stabilities of PER or CRY proteins determine pacemaker period, and PER/CRY complexes have been proposed to afford mutual stabilization, although how PER and CRY proteins with contrasting stabilities interact is unknown. We therefore examined interactions between two mutations in male mice: Fbxl3(Afh), which lengthens period by stabilizing CRY, and Csnk1$\epsilon$(tm1Asil) (CK1$\epsilon$(Tau)), which destabilizes PER, thereby accelerating the clock. By intercrossing these mutants, we show that the stabilities of CRY and PER are independently regulated, contrary to the expectation of mutual stabilization. Segregation of wild-type and mutant alleles generated a spectrum of periods for rest-activity behavior and SCN bioluminescence rhythms. The mutations exerted independent, additive effects on circadian period, biased toward shorter periods determined by CK1$\epsilon$(Tau). Notably, Fbxl3(Afh) extended the duration of the nadir of the PER2-driven bioluminescence rhythm but CK1$\epsilon$(Tau) reversed this, indicating that despite maintained CRY expression, CK1$\epsilon$(Tau) truncated the interval of negative feedback. These results argue for independent, additive biochemical actions of PER and CRY in circadian control, and complement genome-wide epistatic analyses, seeking to decipher the multigenic control of circadian pacemaking.},

Although small molecules that modulate clock function might offer therapeutic approaches to such diseases, only a few compounds have been identified that selectively target core clock proteins. From an unbiased cell-based circadian screen, we identified KL001, a small molecule that specifically interacts with cryptochrome (CRY). KL001 prevented ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CRY, resulting in lengthening of the circadian period. In combination with mathematical modeling, KL001 revealed that CRY1 and CRY2 share a similar functional role in the period regulation. Furthermore, KL001-mediated CRY stabilization inhibited glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes. KL001 thus provides a tool to study the regulation of CRY-dependent physiology and aid development of clock-based therapeutics of diabetes.},

abstract = {The molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes. The role of chromatin remodeling in a physiological setting such as the circadian clock is yet unclear. We show that the protein CLOCK, a central component of the circadian pacemaker, has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. CLOCK shares homology with acetyl-coenzyme A binding motifs within the MYST family of HATs. CLOCK displays high sequence similarity to ACTR, a member of SRC family of HATs, with which it shares also enzymatic specificity for histones H3 and H4. BMAL1, the heterodimerization partner of CLOCK, enhances HAT function. The HAT activity of CLOCK is essential to rescue circadian rhythmicity and activation of clock genes in Clock mutant cells. Identification of CLOCK as a novel type of DNA binding HAT reveals that chromatin remodeling is crucial for the core clock mechanism and identifies unforeseen links between histone acetylation and cellular physiology.},

@article{Noguchi2013,
abstract = {Like neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian pacemaker in the brain, single fibroblasts can function as independent oscillators. In the SCN, synaptic and paracrine signaling among cells creates a robust, synchronized circadian oscillation, whereas there is no evidence for such integration in fibroblast cultures. However, interactions among single-cell fibroblast oscillators cannot be completely excluded, because fibroblasts were not isolated in previous work. In this study, we tested the autonomy of fibroblasts as single-cell circadian oscillators in high- and low-density culture, by single-cell imaging of cells from PER2::LUC circadian reporter mice. We found greatly reduced PER2::LUC rhythmicity in low-density cultures, which could result from lack of either constitutive or rhythmic paracrine signals from neighboring fibroblasts. To discriminate between these 2 possibilities, we mixed PER2::LUC wild-type (WT) cells with nonluminescent, nonrhythmic Bmal1-/- cells, so that density of rhythmic cells was low but overall cell density remained high. In this condition, WT cells showed clear rhythmicity similar to high-density cultures. We also mixed PER2::LUC WT cells with nonluminescent, long period Cry2-/- cells. In this condition, WT cells showed a period no different from cells cultured with rhythmic WT cells or nonrhythmic Bmal1-/- cells. In previous work, we found that low K⁺ suppresses fibroblast rhythmicity, and we and others have found that either low K⁺ or low Ca²⁺ suppresses SCN rhythmicity. Therefore, we attempted to rescue rhythmicity of low-density fibroblasts with high K⁺ (21 mM), high Ca²⁺ (3.6 mM), or conditioned medium. Conditioned medium from high-density fibroblast cultures rescued rhythmicity of low-density cultures, whereas high K⁺ or Ca²⁺ medium did not consistently rescue rhythmicity. These data suggest that fibroblasts require paracrine signals from adjacent cells for normal expression of rhythmicity, but that these signals do not have to be rhythmic, and that rhythmic signals from other cells do not affect the intrinsic periods of fibroblasts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cyanobacterial circadian clock system has been extensively studied, and the structures, interactions, and biochemical activities of the central oscillator proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) have been well elucidated. Despite this rich repository of information, little is known about the distribution of these proteins within the cell. RESULTS: Here we report that KaiA and KaiC localize as discrete foci near a single pole of cells in a clock-dependent fashion, with enhanced polar localization observed at night. KaiA localization is dependent on KaiC; consistent with this notion, KaiA and KaiC colocalize with each other, as well as with CikA, a key input and output factor previously reported to display unipolar localization. The molecular mechanism that localizes KaiC to the poles is conserved in Escherichia coli, another Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, suggesting that KaiC localization is not dependent on other clock- or cyanobacterial-specific factors. Moreover, expression of CikA mutant variants that distribute diffusely results in the striking delocalization of KaiC. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that the cyanobacterial circadian system undergoes a circadian orchestration of subcellular organization. We propose that the observed spatiotemporal localization pattern represents a novel layer of regulation that contributes to the robustness of the clock by facilitating protein complex formation and synchronizing the clock with environmental stimuli.},

Here, we demonstrate that CLOCK/BMAL1, the core circadian clock components, reduces maximal GR transactivation (Amax) as well as efficacy (EC50) by a novel mechanism that requires binding to DNA and transactivation of target genes. Accordingly, we observe that PER1 and CRY1, the primary targets of CLOCK/BMAL1 action, reduce maximal GR transactivation while not affecting the efficacy. Moreover, we observe hyper-activations of GRE-dependent transcription in BMAL1- or PERs-deficient MEFs. In addition, endogenous GC target genes expression negatively correlates with the CLOCK/BMAL1 activity. Considering that GC sensitivity is widely implicated in human health and diseases, these results provide valuable insights into plethora of GC-related physiology and pathology.},

@article{Gutenkunst2007,
abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

abstract = {The hepatic circadian clock plays a key role in the daily regulation of glucose metabolism, but the precise molecular mechanisms that coordinate these two biological processes are not fully understood. In this study, we identify a novel connection between the regulation of ROR$\gamma$ by the clock machinery and the diurnal regulation of glucose metabolic networks. We demonstrate that particularly at daytime, mice deficient in ROR$\gamma$ exhibit improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance due to reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis. This is associated with a reduced peak expression of several glucose metabolic genes critical in the control of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Genome-wide cistromic profiling, promoter and mutation analysis support the concept that ROR$\gamma$ regulates the transcription of several glucose metabolic genes directly by binding ROREs in their promoter regulatory region. Similar observations were made in liver-specific ROR$\gamma$-deficient mice suggesting that the changes in glucose homeostasis were directly related to the loss of hepatic ROR$\gamma$ expression. Altogether, our study shows that ROR$\gamma$ regulates several glucose metabolic genes downstream of the hepatic clock and identifies a novel metabolic function for ROR$\gamma$ in the diurnal regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin sensitivity. The inhibition of the activation of several metabolic gene promoters by an ROR$\gamma$ antagonist suggests that antagonists may provide a novel strategy in the management of metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Circadian organization changes with age, but we do not know the extent to which age-related changes are the result of alterations in the central pacemakers, the peripheral oscillators, or the coupling mechanisms that hold the system together. By using transgenic rats with a luciferase (luc) reporter, we assessed the effects of aging on the rhythm of expression of the Period 1 (Per1) gene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and in peripheral tissues. Young (2 months) and aged (24-26 months) Per1-luc transgenic rats, entrained to light-dark cycles, were killed, and tissues were removed and cultured. Per1-luc expression was measured from 10 tissues. In the SCN, the central mammalian pacemaker, Per1-luc expression was robustly rhythmic for more than 7 weeks in culture. The only difference between SCN rhythmicity in young and old rats was a small but significant age-related shortening of the free-running period. Circadian rhythmicity in some peripheral tissues was unaffected by aging, whereas rhythmicity in other tissues was either phase advanced relative to the light cycle or absent. Those tissues that were arrhythmic could be induced to oscillate by application of forskolin, suggesting that they retained the capacity to oscillate but were not being appropriately driven in vivo. Overall, the results provide new insights into the effects of aging on the mammalian circadian system. Aging seems to affect rhythms in some but not in all tissues and may act primarily on interactions among circadian oscillators, perhaps attenuating the ability of the SCN to drive damped oscillators in the periphery.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian clock is a cell-autonomous system that drives oscillations in behavior and physiology in anticipation of daily environmental change. To assess the robustness of a human molecular clock, we systematically depleted known clock components and observed that circadian oscillations are maintained over a wide range of disruptions. We developed a novel strategy termed Gene Dosage Network Analysis (GDNA) in which small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced dose-dependent changes in gene expression were used to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints. The use of multiple doses powered the analysis to uncover several novel network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses and signal propagation through interacting genetic modules. We also observed several examples where a gene is up-regulated following knockdown of its paralog, suggesting the clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. We propose that these network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.},

The code specifies the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that underlie all major developmental events. Models of GRNs are required for analysis, for experimental manipulation and, most fundamentally, for comprehension of how GRNs work. To model GRNs requires knowledge of both their overall structure, which depends upon linkage amongst regulatory genes, and the modular building blocks of which GRNs are heirarchically constructed. The building blocks consist of basic transcriptional control processes executed by one or a few functionally linked genes. We show how the functions of several such building blocks can be considered in mathematical terms, and discuss resolution of GRNs by both "top down" and "bottom up" approaches.},

abstract = {We previously analyzed transcriptional regulation of the BMAL1 gene, a critical component of the mammalian clock system and found that the BMAL1 gene is expressed with circadian oscillation and that its regulatory region is located in hypomethylated CpG islands with an open chromatin structure. Here, we found that the BMAL1 gene is not expressed with circadian oscillation in CPT-K cells because the CpG islands located in the BMAL1 promoter are hypermethylated and that 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) recovered BMAL1 expression. In contrast, CpG islands in the PER2 promoter were hypomethylated, the PER2 gene was expressed and aza-dC enhanced PER2 gene expression in CPT-K cells. Reporter gene assays showed that intracellular transcriptional machinery for the BMAL1 gene is active, suggesting that BMAL1 inactivation is caused by DNA methylation and not by malfunctional promoter activity. Incubating CPT-K cells with aza-dC also increased CRY1 expression, whereas CLOCK expression was not altered and the CRY1 promoter was unmethylated. These results suggest that aza-dC induces BMAL1 expression via DNA demethylation in the BMAL1 promoter and enhances PER2 and CRY1 transcription. Finally, aza-dC recovered the circadian oscillation of BMAL1 transcription. These results suggest that DNA methylation of the BMAL1 gene is critical for interfering with circadian rhythms.},

abstract = {The circadian clock co-ordinates physiology and behavior with the day/night cycle. It consists of a transcriptional-translational feedback loop that generates self-sustained oscillations in transcriptional activity with a roughly 24h period via E-box enhancer elements. Numerous in vivo aspects of core clock feedback loop function are still incompletely understood, including its maturation during development, tissue-specific activity and perturbation in disease states. Zebrafish are promising models for biomedical research due to their high regenerative capacity and suitability for in vivo drug screens, and transgenic zebrafish lines are valuable tools to study transcriptional activity in vivo during development. To monitor the activity of the core clock feedback loop in vivo, we created a transgenic zebrafish line expressing a luciferase reporter gene under the regulation of a minimal promoter and four E-boxes. This Tg(4xE-box:Luc) line shows robust oscillating reporter gene expression both under light-dark cycles and upon release into constant darkness. Luciferase activity starts to oscillate during the first days of development, indicating that the core clock loop is already functional at an early stage. To test whether the Tg(4xE-box:Luc) line could be used in drug screens aimed at identifying compounds that target the circadian clock in vivo, we examined drug effects on circadian period. We were readily able to detect period changes as low as 0.7h upon treatment with the period-lengthening drugs lithium chloride and longdaysin in an assay set-up suitable for large-scale screens. Reporter gene mRNA expression is also detected in the adult brain and reveals differential clock activity across the brain, overlapping with endogenous clock gene expression. Notably, core clock activity is strongly correlated with brain regions where neurogenesis takes place and can be detected in several types of neural progenitors. Our results demonstrate that the Tg(4xE-box:Luc) line is an excellent tool for studying the regulation of the circadian clock and its maturation in vivo and in real-time. Furthermore, it is highly suitable for in vivo screens targeting the core clock mechanism that take into account the complexity of an intact organism. Finally, it allows mapping of clock activity in the brain of a vertebrate model organism with prominent adult neurogenesis and high regeneration capacity.},

abstract = {Cryptochromes regulate the circadian clock in animals and plants. Humans and mice have two cryptochrome (Cry) genes. A previous study showed that mice lacking the Cry2 gene had reduced sensitivity to acute light induction of the circadian gene mPer1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and had an intrinsic period 1 hr longer than normal. In this study, Cry1(-/-) and Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice were generated and their circadian clocks were analyzed at behavioral and molecular levels. Behaviorally, the Cry1(-/-) mice had a circadian period 1 hr shorter than wild type and the Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice were arrhythmic in constant darkness (DD). Biochemically, acute light induction of mPer1 mRNA in the SCN was blunted in Cry1(-/-) and abolished in Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice. In contrast, the acute light induction of mPer2 in the SCN was intact in Cry1(-/-) and Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) animals. Importantly, in double mutants, mPer1 expression was constitutively elevated and no rhythmicity was detected in either 12-hr light/12-hr dark or DD, whereas mPer2 expression appeared rhythmic in 12-hr light/12-hr dark, but nonrhythmic in DD with intermediate levels. These results demonstrate that Cry1 and Cry2 are required for the normal expression of circadian behavioral rhythms, as well as circadian rhythms of mPer1 and mPer2 in the SCN. The differential regulation of mPer1 and mPer2 by light in Cry double mutants reveals a surprising complexity in the role of cryptochromes in mammals.},

abstract = {Mammalian circadian clocks consist of complexly integrated regulatory loops, making it difficult to elucidate them without both the accurate measurement of system dynamics and the comprehensive identification of network circuits. Toward a system-level understanding of this transcriptional circuitry, we identified clock-controlled elements on 16 clock and clock-controlled genes in a comprehensive surveillance of evolutionarily conserved cis elements and measurement of their transcriptional dynamics. Here we report the roles of E/E' boxes, DBP/E4BP4 binding elements and RevErbA/ROR binding elements in nine, seven and six genes, respectively. Our results indicate that circadian transcriptional circuits are governed by two design principles: regulation of E/E' boxes and RevErbA/ROR binding elements follows a repressor-precedes-activator pattern, resulting in delayed transcriptional activity, whereas regulation of DBP/E4BP4 binding elements follows a repressor-antiphasic-to-activator mechanism, which generates high-amplitude transcriptional activity. Our analysis further suggests that regulation of E/E' boxes is a topological vulnerability in mammalian circadian clocks, a concept that has been functionally verified using in vitro phenotype assay systems.},

abstract = {Mammalian circadian oscillators are considered to rely on transcription/translation feedback loops in clock gene expression. The major and essential loop involves the autorepression of cryptochrome (Cry1, Cry2) and period (Per1, Per2) genes. The rhythm-generating circuitry is functional in most cell types, including cultured fibroblasts. Using this system, we show that significant reduction in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription did not abolish circadian oscillations, but surprisingly accelerated them. A similar period shortening was observed at reduced incubation temperatures in wild-type mouse fibroblasts, but not in cells lacking Per1. Our data suggest that mammalian circadian oscillators are resilient to large fluctuations in general transcription rates and temperature, and that PER1 has an important function in transcription and temperature compensation.},

abstract = {While diet-induced obesity has been exclusively attributed to increased caloric intake from fat, animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD) ad libitum (ad lib) eat frequently throughout day and night, disrupting the normal feeding cycle. To test whether obesity and metabolic diseases result from HFD or disruption of metabolic cycles, we subjected mice to either ad lib or time-restricted feeding (tRF) of a HFD for 8 hr per day. Mice under tRF consume equivalent calories from HFD as those with ad lib access yet are protected against obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation and have improved motor coordination. The tRF regimen improved CREB, mTOR, and AMPK pathway function and oscillations of the circadian clock and their target genes' expression. These changes in catabolic and anabolic pathways altered liver metabolome and improved nutrient utilization and energy expenditure. We demonstrate in mice that tRF regimen is a nonpharmacological strategy against obesity and associated diseases.},

abstract = {Cultured circadian oscillators from peripheral tissues were recently shown to be both cell-autonomous and self-sustained. Therefore, the dominant cause for amplitude reduction observed in bioluminescence recordings of cultured fibroblasts is desynchronization, rather than the damping of individual oscillators. Here, we review a generic model for quantifying luminescence signals from biochemical oscillators, based on noisy-phase oscillators. Our model incorporates three essential features of circadian clocks: the stability of the limit cycle, fluctuations, and intercellular coupling. The model is then used to analyze bioluminescence recordings from immortalized and primary fibroblasts. Fits to population recordings allow simultaneous estimation of the stability of the limit cycle (or equivalently, the stiffness of individual frequencies), the period dispersion, and the interaction strength between cells. Consistent with other work, coupling is found to be weak and insufficient to synchronize cells. Interestingly, we find that frequency fluctuations remain correlated for longer periods than one clock cycle, which is confirmed from individual cell recordings. We discuss briefly how to link the generic model with more microscopic models, which suggests mechanisms by which circadian oscillators resist fluctuations and maintain accurate timing in the periphery.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mathematical modelling of biological systems is becoming a standard approach to investigate complex dynamic, non-linear interaction mechanisms in cellular processes. However, models may comprise non-identifiable parameters which cannot be unambiguously determined. Non-identifiability manifests itself in functionally related parameters, which are difficult to detect. RESULTS: We present the method of mean optimal transformations, a non-parametric bootstrap-based algorithm for identifiability testing, capable of identifying linear and non-linear relations of arbitrarily many parameters, regardless of model size or complexity. This is performed with use of optimal transformations, estimated using the alternating conditional expectation algorithm (ACE). An initial guess or prior knowledge concerning the underlying relation of the parameters is not required. Independent, and hence identifiable parameters are determined as well. The quality of data at disposal is included in our approach, i.e. the non-linear model is fitted to data and estimated parameter values are investigated with respect to functional relations. We exemplify our approach on a realistic dynamical model and demonstrate that the variability of estimated parameter values decreases from 81 to 1\% after detection and fixation of structural non-identifiabilities.},

We found persistent, independent circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in 6-week-long bioluminescence recordings of 80 primary fibroblast cells dissociated from PER2::LUC mice and kept in vitro for 6 months. Due to the stochastic nature of rhythmicity, the proportion of cells appearing rhythmic increases with the length of interval examined, with 100\% of cells found to be rhythmic when using 3-week windows. Mean period and amplitude are remarkably stable throughout the 6-week recordings, with precision improving over time. For individual cells, precision of period and amplitude are correlated with cell size and rhythm amplitude, but not with period, and period exhibits much less cycle-to-cycle variability (CV 7.3\%) than does amplitude (CV 37\%). The time series are long enough to distinguish stochastic fluctuations within each cell from differences among cells, and we conclude that the cells do exhibit significant heterogeneity in period and strength of rhythmicity, which we measure using a novel statistical metric. Furthermore, stochastic modeling suggests that these single-cell clocks operate near a Hopf bifurcation, such that intrinsic noise enhances the oscillations by minimizing period variability and sustaining amplitude.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are regulated at the post-translational level by a variety of processes among which protein phosphorylation plays a prominent, although complex, role. Thus, the phosphorylation of different sites on the clock protein PER by casein kinase I (CKI) can lead to opposite effects on the stability of the protein and on the period of circadian oscillations. Here the authors extend a computational model previously proposed for the mammalian circadian clock by incorporating two distinct phosphorylations of PER by CKI. On the basis of experimental observations the authors consider that phosphorylation at one site (denoted here PER-P1) enhances the rate of degradation of the protein and decreases the period, while phosphorylation at another site (PER-P2) stabilises the protein, enhances the transcription of the Per gene, and increases the period. The model also incorporates an additional phosphorylation of PER by the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3). The authors show that the extended model incorporating the antagonistic effects of PER phosphorylations by CKI can account for observations pertaining to (i) the decrease in period in the Tau mutant, because of an increase in phosphorylation by CKI leading to PER-P1, and (ii) the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) in which the period is shortened and the phase of the oscillations is advanced when the rate of phosphorylation leading to PER-P2 is decreased. The model further accounts for the increase in period observed in the presence of CKI inhibitors that decrease the rate of phosphorylation leading to both PER-P1 and PER-P2. A similar increase in period results from inhibition of GSK3. [Includes supplementary material].},

abstract = {Advancing or delaying the light-dark (LD) cycle perturbs the circadian clock, which eventually recovers its original phase with respect to the new LD cycle. Readjustment of the clock occurs by shifting its phase in the same (orthodromic re-entrainment) or opposite direction (antidromic re-entrainment) as the shift in the LD cycle. To investigate circadian clock recovery after phase shifts of the LD cycle we use a detailed computational model previously proposed for the cellular regulatory network underlying the mammalian circadian clock. The model predicts the existence of a sharp threshold separating orthodromic from antidromic re-entrainment. In the vicinity of this threshold, resynchronization of the clock after a phase shift markedly slows down. The type of re-entrainment, the position of the threshold and the time required for resynchronization depend on multiple factors such as the autonomous period of the clock, the direction and magnitude of the phase shift, the clock biochemical kinetic parameters, and light intensity. Partitioning the phase shift into a series of smaller phases shifts decreases the impact on the recovery of the circadian clock. We use the phase response curve to predict the location of the threshold separating orthodromic and antidromic re-entrainment after advanced or delayed phase shifts of the LD cycle. The marked increase in recovery times predicted near the threshold could be responsible for the most severe disturbances of the human circadian clock associated with jet lag.},

abstract = {Robust synchronization is a critical feature of several systems including the mammalian circadian clock. The master circadian clock in mammals consists of about 20000 'sloppy' neuronal oscillators within the hypothalamus that keep robust time by synchronization driven by inter-neuronal coupling. The complete understanding of this synchronization in the mammalian circadian clock and the mechanisms underlying it remain an open question. Experiments and computational studies have shown that coupling individual oscillators can achieve robust synchrony, despite heterogeneity and different network topologies. But, much less is known regarding the mechanisms and circuits involved in achieving this coupling, due to both system complexity and experimental limitations. Here, we computationally study the coupling mediated by the primary coupling neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and its canonical receptor, VPAC2R, using the transcriptional elements and generic mode of VIP-VPAC2R signaling. We find that synchrony is only possible if VIP (an inducer of Per expression) is released in-phase with activators of Per expression. Moreover, anti-phasic VIP release suppresses coherent rhythms by moving the network into a desynchronous state. Importantly, experimentally observed rhythms in VPAC2R have little effect on network synchronization, but can improve the amplitude of the SCN network rhythms while narrowing the network entrainment range. We further show that these findings are valid across several computational network models. Thus, we identified a general design principle to achieve robust synchronization: An activating coupling agent, such as VIP, must act in-phase with the activity of core-clock promoters. More generally, the phase of coupling is as critical as the strength of coupling from the viewpoint of synchrony and entrainment.},

However, due to the lack of appropriate in vivo recording technologies, it has been difficult to study how the SCN synchronizes oscillators in peripheral tissues. Here we describe the real-time recording of bioluminescence emitted by hepatocytes expressing circadian luciferase reporter genes in freely moving mice. The technology employs a device dubbed RT-Biolumicorder, which consists of a cylindrical cage with reflecting conical walls that channel photons toward a photomultiplier tube. The monitoring of circadian liver gene expression revealed that hepatocyte oscillators of SCN-lesioned mice synchronized more rapidly to feeding cycles than hepatocyte clocks of intact mice. Hence, the SCN uses signaling pathways that counteract those of feeding rhythms when their phase is in conflict with its own phase.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks drive endogenous oscillations in organisms across the tree of life. The Earth's daily light/dark cycle entrains these clocks to the environment. Two major theories of light entrainment have been presented in the literature. The discrete theory emphasizes the instantaneous phase-shifting behavior of short pulses of light, and the continuous theory emphasizes changes to the period of oscillations in constant-light conditions. Historically, the primary tool for predicting and understanding discrete entrainment has been the PRC, which measures discrete adjustments to the clock's phase. The authors present a unified theory, which relies on a velocity response curve (VRC), similar in shape to a PRC, but that describes continuous adjustments to the clock's speed. The VRC explains data from both discrete and continuous light experiments and is therefore an invaluable tool to understand entrainment. The authors relate VRC features to specific entrainment behaviors, such as seasonal adjustments to the phase of entrainment. Furthermore, they estimate a VRC from PRC data and successfully reproduce additional PRC data. Finally, they entrain a VRC-based model to natural light/dark cycles, demonstrating the unified theory's ability to predict clock behavior in the face of a fluctuating signal. The results indicate that a VRC-based model not only provides a comprehensive understanding of entrainment but also has excellent predictive capabilities.},

abstract = {Robustness, a relative insensitivity to perturbations, is a key characteristic of living cells. However, the specific structural characteristics that are responsible for robust performance are not clear, even in genetic circuits of moderate complexity. Formal sensitivity analysis allows the investigation of robustness and fragility properties of mathematical models representing regulatory networks, but it yields only local properties with respect to a particular choice of parameter values. Here, we show that by systematically investigating the parameter space, more global properties linked to network structure can be derived. Our analysis focuses on the genetic oscillator responsible for generating circadian rhythms in Drosophila as a prototypic dynamical cellular system. Analysis of two mathematical models of moderate complexity shows that the tradeoff between robustness and fragility is largely determined by the regulatory structure. Rank-ordered sensitivities, for instance, allow the correct identification of protein phosphorylation as an influential process determining the oscillator's period. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms the theoretical insight that hierarchical control might be important for achieving robustness. The complex feedback structures encountered in vivo, however, do not seem to enhance robustness per se but confer robust precision and adjustability of the clock while avoiding catastrophic failure.},

abstract = {Peripheral cells from mammalian tissues, while perfectly capable of circadian rhythm generation, are not light sensitive and thus have to be entrained by nonphotic cues. Feeding time is the dominant zeitgeber for peripheral mammalian clocks: Daytime feeding of nocturnal laboratory rodents completely inverts the phase of circadian gene expression in many tissues, including liver, heart, kidney, and pancreas, but it has no effect on the SCN pacemaker. It is thus plausible that in intact animals, the SCN synchronizes peripheral docks primarily through temporal feeding patterns that are imposed through behavioral rest-activity cycles. In addition, body temperature rhythms, which are themselves dependent on both feeding patterns and rest-activity cycles, can sustain circadian, clock gene activity in vivo and in vitro. The SCN may also influence the phase of rhythmic gene expression in peripheral tissues through direct chemical pathways. In fact, many chemical signals induce circadian gene expression in tissue culture cells. Some of these have been shown to elicit phase shifts when injected into intact animals and are thus candidates for physiologically relevant timing cues. While the response of the SCN to light is strictly gated to respond only during the night, peripheral oscillators can be chemically phase shifted throughout the day. For example, injection of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, resets the phase of circadian liver gene expression during the entire 24-h day. Given the bewildering array of agents capable of influencing peripheral clocks, the identification of physiologically relevant agents used by the SCN to synchronize peripheral clocks will clearly be an arduous undertaking. Nevertheless, we feel that experimental systems by which this enticing problem can be tackled are now at hand.},

The temporal program in this organism enhances fitness in rhythmic environments and is truly global--essentially all genes are regulated by the circadian system. The topology of the chromosome also oscillates and possibly regulates the rhythm of gene expression. The underlying circadian mechanism appears to consist of both a post-translational oscillator (PTO) and a transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL). The PTO can be reconstituted in vitro with three purified proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) and ATP. These three core oscillator proteins have been crystallized and structurally determined, the only full-length circadian proteins to be so characterized. The timing of cell division is gated by a circadian checkpoint, but the circadian pacemaker is not influenced by the status of the cell division cycle. This imperturbability may be due to the presence of the PTO that persists under conditions in which metabolism is repressed. Recent biochemical, biophysical, and structural discoveries have brought the cyanobacterial circadian system to the brink of explaining heretofore unexplainable biochemical characteristics of a circadian oscillator: the long time constant, precision, and temperature compensation.},

Using computational modeling, we present evidence of synergistic nodes between the circadian transcriptome and specific metabolic pathways. Validation of these nodes reveals that diverse metabolic pathways, including the uracil salvage pathway, oscillate in a circadian fashion and in a CLOCK-dependent manner.

abstract = {Circadian oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) depend on transcriptional repression by Period (PER)1 and PER2 proteins within single cells and on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) signaling between cells. Because VIP is released by SCN neurons in a circadian pattern, and, after photic stimulation, it has been suggested to play a role in the synchronization to environmental light cycles. It is not known, however, if or how VIP entrains circadian gene expression or behavior. Here, we tested candidate signaling pathways required for VIP-mediated entrainment of SCN rhythms. We found that single applications of VIP reset PER2 rhythms in a time- and dose-dependent manner that differed from light. Unlike VIP-mediated signaling in other cell types, simultaneous antagonism of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C activities was required to block the VIP-induced phase shifts of SCN rhythms. Consistent with this, VIP rapidly increased intracellular cAMP in most SCN neurons. Critically, daily VIP treatment entrained PER2 rhythms to a predicted phase angle within several days, depending on the concentration of VIP and the interval between VIP applications. We conclude that VIP entrains circadian timing among SCN neurons through rapid and parallel changes in adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C activities.},

However, during the cellular life cycle thousands of different reactions occur, which makes it very difficult to build a detailed large-scale ldnetic model. In this work, we provide a critical overview of specific limitations found during the reconstruction of the central carbon metabolism dynamic model from E. coli (based on kinetic data available). In addition, we provide clues that will hopefully allow the systems biology community to more accurately construct metabolic dynamic models in the future. The difficulties faced during the construction of dynamic models are due not only to the lack of kinetic information but also to the fact that some data are still not curated. We hope that in the future, with the standardization of the in vitro enzyme protocols the approximation of in vitro conditions to the in vivo ones, it will be possible to integrate the available kinetic data into a complete large scale model. We also expect that collaborative projects between modellers and biologists will provide valuable kinetic data and permit the exchange of important information to solve most of these issues.},

However, if animals have access to food only during their normal sleep cycle, they will shift most of their circadian rhythms to match the food availability. We studied the basis for entrainment of circadian rhythms by food and light in mice with targeted disruption of the clock gene Bmal1, which lack circadian rhythmicity. Injection of a viral vector containing the Bmal1 gene into the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus restored light-entrainable, but not food-entrainable, circadian rhythms. In contrast, restoration of the Bmal1 gene only in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus restored the ability of animals to entrain to food but not to light. These results demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains a Bmal1-based oscillator that can drive food entrainment of circadian rhythms.},

abstract = {In animals, circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior result from coherent rhythmic interactions between clocks in the brain and those throughout the body. Despite the many tissue specific clocks, most understanding of the molecular core clock mechanism comes from studies of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and a few other cell types. Here we report establishment and genetic characterization of three cell-autonomous mouse clock models: 3T3 fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and MMH-D3 hepatocytes. Each model is genetically tractable and has an integrated luciferase reporter that allows for longitudinal luminescence recording of rhythmic clock gene expression using an inexpensive off-the-shelf microplate reader. To test these cellular models, we generated a library of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against a panel of known clock genes and evaluated their impact on circadian rhythms. Knockdown of Bmal1, Clock, Cry1, and Cry2 each resulted in similar phenotypes in all three models, consistent with previous studies. However, we observed cell type-specific knockdown phenotypes for the Period and Rev-Erb families of clock genes. In particular, Per1 and Per2, which have strong behavioral effects in knockout mice, appear to play different roles in regulating period length and amplitude in these peripheral systems. Per3, which has relatively modest behavioral effects in knockout mice, substantially affects period length in the three cellular models and in dissociated SCN neurons. In summary, this study establishes new cell-autonomous clock models that are of particular relevance to metabolism and suitable for screening for clock modifiers, and reveals previously under-appreciated cell type-specific functions of clock genes.},

abstract = {Metabolic engineering involves application of recombinant DNA methods to manipulate metabolic networks to improve cellular properties. It is critical that the genetic alterations be performed in an optimal manner to maximize profit. In addition to the product yield, productivity consideration is also critical, especially for the production of bulk chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol. In this work, we demonstrate that it is suboptimal from the standpoint of productivity to induce genetic alteration at the start of the production process. A bi-level optimization scheme is formulated to determine the optimal temporal flux profile for the manipulated reaction. In the first case study, an optimal flux in the reaction catalyzed by glycerol kinase is determined to maximize the glycerol production at the end of a 6-h batch cultivation of Escherichia coli under aerobic conditions. The final glycerol concentration is 30\% higher for the optimal flux profile compared with having an active flux during the entire batch. The effect of the mass transfer coefficient on the optimal profile and the glycerol concentration is also determined. In the second case study, the anaerobic batch fermentation of the ldh(-) strain of Escherichia coli is considered. The optimal flux in the acetate pathway is determined to maximize the final ethanol concentration. The optimal flux results in higher ethanol concentration (11.92 mmol L(-1)) compared to strains with no acetate flux (8.36 mmol L(-1)) and fully active acetate flux (6.22 mmol L(-1)). We also examine the effects of growth inhibition due to high ethanol concentrations and variations in final batch time on ethanol production.},

Affected individuals have a serine to glycine mutation within the casein kinase Iepsilon (CKIepsilon) binding region of hPER2, which causes hypophosphorylation by CKIepsilon in vitro. Thus, a variant in human sleep behavior can be attributed to a missense mutation in a clock component, hPER2, which alters the circadian period.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian clock is a molecular oscillator composed of a feedback loop that involves transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1, and repressors Cryptochrome (CRY) and Period (PER). Here we show that a direct CLOCK-BMAL1 target gene, Gm129, is a novel regulator of the feedback loop. ChIP analysis revealed that the CLOCK:BMAL1:CRY1 complex strongly occupies the promoter region of Gm129. Both mRNA and protein levels of GM129 exhibit high amplitude circadian oscillations in mouse liver, and Gm129 gene encodes a nuclear-localized protein that directly interacts with BMAL1 and represses CLOCK:BMAL1 activity. In vitro and in vivo protein-DNA interaction results demonstrate that, like CRY1, GM129 functions as a repressor by binding to the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex on DNA. Although Gm129-/- or Cry1-/- Gm129-/- mice retain a robust circadian rhythm, the peaks of Nr1d1 and Dbp mRNAs in liver exhibit significant phase delay compared to control. Our results suggest that, in addition to CRYs and PERs, GM129 protein contributes to the transcriptional feedback loop by modulating CLOCK:BMAL1 activity as a transcriptional repressor.},

abstract = {Classical sensitivity analysis is routinely used to identify points of fragility or robustness in biochemical networks. However, intracellular systems often contain components that number in the thousands to tens or less and consequently motivate a stochastic treatment. Although methodologies exist to quantify sensitivities in stochastic models, they differ substantially from those used in deterministic regimes. Therefore it is not possible to tell whether observed differences in sensitivity measured in deterministic and stochastic elaborations of the same network are the result of methodology or model form. The authors introduce here a distribution-based methodology to measure sensitivity that is equally applicable in both regimes, and demonstrate its use and applicability on a sophisticated mathematical model of the mouse circadian clock that is available in both deterministic and stochastic variants. The authors use the method to produce sensitivity measurements on both variants. They note that the rank-order sensitivity of the clock to parametric perturbations is extremely well conserved across several orders of magnitude. The data show that the clock is fragile to perturbations in parameters common to the cellular machinery ('global' parameters) and robust to perturbations in parameters that are clock-specific ('local' parameters). The sensitivity measure can be used to reduce the model from its original 73 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to 18 ODEs and to predict the degree to which parametric perturbation can distort the phase response curve of the clock. Finally, the method is employed to evaluate the effect of transcriptional and translational noise on clock function. [Includes supplementary material].},

Two tools from control engineering are applied to a mathematical model of Fas ligand signaling-induced apoptosis. Structured singular value analysis determines the volume in parameter space within which the system parameters may exist and still maintain efficacious signaling, but is limited to linear behaviors. Sensitivity analysis can be applied to nonlinear systems but is difficult to relate to performance criteria. Thus, structured singular value analysis is used to quantify performance during apoptosis rejection, ensuring that the system remains sensitive but not overly so to apoptotic stimuli. Sensitivity analysis is applied when the system has switched to the death-inducing, apoptotic steady state to determine parameters significant to maintaining the bistability. The analyses reveal that the magnitude of the death signal is fragile to perturbations in degradation parameters (failures in the ubiquitin/proteasome mechanism) while the timing of signal expression can be tuned by manipulating local parameters. Simultaneous parameter uncertainty highlights apoptotic fragility to disturbances in the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the robust signaling characteristics of the apoptotic network is due to network architecture, and the apoptotic signaling threshold is best manipulated by interactions upstream of the apoptosome.},

abstract = {PERIOD (PER) proteins are central components within the mammalian circadian oscillator, and are believed to form a negative feedback complex that inhibits their own transcription at a particular circadian phase. Phosphorylation of PER proteins regulates their stability as well as their subcellular localization. In a systematic screen, we have identified 21 phosphorylated residues of mPER2 including Ser 659, which is mutated in patients suffering from familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS). When expressing FASPS-mutated mPER2 in oscillating fibroblasts, we can phenocopy the short period and advanced phase of FASPS patients' behavior. We show that phosphorylation at Ser 659 results in nuclear retention and stabilization of mPER2, whereas phosphorylation at other sites leads to mPER2 degradation. To conceptualize our findings, we use mathematical modeling and predict that differential PER phosphorylation events can result in opposite period phenotypes. Indeed, interference with specific aspects of mPER2 phosphorylation leads to either short or long periods in oscillating fibroblasts. This concept explains not only the FASPS phenotype, but also the effect of the tau mutation in hamster as well as the doubletime mutants (dbtS and dbtL ) in Drosophila.},

abstract = {CikA (circadian input kinase) is a component of the cyanobacterial circadian clock that aids in synchronizing the endogenous oscillator with the external environment. cikA mutants of the prokaryotic circadian model organism Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 fail to reset the phase of the circadian rhythm of gene expression after an environmental time cue, and also exhibit reduced amplitude and shortened period of circadian oscillation. CikA has histidine protein kinase (HPK) activity that is modulated in vitro by GAF and pseudo-receiver (PsR) domains. Here we show that the PsR domain negatively regulates HPK activity in vivo and also serves as an interaction module to dock CikA at a specific subcellular location. Phenotypes conferred by alleles that encode CikA variants showed that all domains except the featureless N-terminus are required for CikA function. Overexpression of all alleles that encode the PsR domain, whether or not the HPK is functional, caused a dominant arrhythmic phenotype, whereas overexpressed variants that lack PsR did not. Subcellular localization of intact CikA identified a polar focus whereas a variant without PsR showed uniform distribution in the cell, consistent with a model in which PsR mediates interaction with other input pathway components.},

abstract = {Biological rhythms, generated by feedback loops containing interacting genes, proteins and/or cells, time physiological processes in many organisms. While many of the components of the systems that generate biological rhythms have been identified, much less is known about the details of their interactions. Using examples from the circadian (daily) clock in three organisms, Neurospora, Drosophila and mouse, we show, with mathematical models of varying complexity, how interactions among (i) promoter sites, (ii) proteins forming complexes, and (iii) cells can have a drastic effect on timekeeping. Inspired by the identification of many transcription factors, for example as involved in the Neurospora circadian clock, that can both activate and repress, we show how these multiple actions can cause complex oscillatory patterns in a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL). Inspired by the timekeeping complex formed by the NMO-PER-TIM-SGG complex that regulates the negative TTFL in the Drosophila circadian clock, we show how the mechanism of complex formation can determine the prevalence of oscillations in a TTFL. Finally, we note that most mathematical models of intracellular clocks model a single cell, but compare with experimental data from collections of cells. We find that refitting the most detailed model of the mammalian circadian clock, so that the coupling between cells matches experimental data, yields different dynamics and makes an interesting prediction that also matches experimental data: individual cells are bistable, and network coupling removes this bistability and causes the network to be more robust to external perturbations. Taken together, we propose that the interactions between components in biological timekeeping systems are carefully tuned towards proper function. We also show how timekeeping can be controlled by novel mechanisms at different levels of organization.},

This has raised the possibility that pharmacological manipulation of melanopsin can modulate several central nervous system responses, including photophobia, sleep, circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine function. Here we describe the identification of a potent synthetic melanopsin antagonist with in vivo activity. New sulfonamide compounds inhibiting melanopsin (opsinamides) compete with retinal binding to melanopsin and inhibit its function without affecting rod- and cone-mediated responses. In vivo administration of opsinamides to mice specifically and reversibly modified melanopsin-dependent light responses, including the pupillary light reflex and light aversion. The discovery of opsinamides raises the prospect of therapeutic control of the melanopsin phototransduction system to regulate light-dependent behavior and remediate pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Circadian oscillations are generated by the purified cyanobacterial clock proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, through rhythmic interactions that depend on multisite phosphorylation of KaiC. However, the mechanisms that allow these phosphorylation reactions to robustly control the timing of oscillations over a range of protein stoichiometries are not clear. We show that when KaiC hexamers consist of a mixture of differentially phosphorylated subunits, the two phosphorylation sites have opposing effects on the ability of each hexamer to bind to the negative regulator KaiB. We likewise show that the ability of the positive regulator KaiA to act on KaiC depends on the phosphorylation state of the hexamer and that KaiA and KaiB recognize alternative allosteric states of the KaiC ring. Using mathematical models with kinetic parameters taken from experimental data, we find that antagonism of the two KaiC phosphorylation sites generates an ultrasensitive switch in negative feedback strength necessary for stable circadian oscillations over a range of component concentrations. Similar strategies based on opposing modifications may be used to support robustness in other timing systems and in cellular signaling more generally.},

abstract = {We previously reported emergence and disappearance of circadian molecular oscillations during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and reprogramming of differentiated cells, respectively. Here we present a robust and stringent in vitro circadian clock formation assay that recapitulates in vivo circadian phenotypes. This assay system first confirmed that a mutant ES cell line lacking Casein Kinase I delta (CKI$\delta$) induced ∼3 hours longer period-length of circadian rhythm than the wild type, which was compatible with recently reported results using CKI$\delta$ null mice. In addition, this assay system also revealed that a Casein Kinase 2 alpha subunit (CK2$\alpha$) homozygous mutant ES cell line developed significantly longer (about 2.5 hours) periods of circadian clock oscillations after in vitro or in vivo differentiation. Moreover, revertant ES cell lines in which mutagenic vector sequences were deleted showed nearly wild type periods after differentiation, indicating that the abnormal circadian period of the mutant ES cell line originated from the mutation in the CK2$\alpha$ gene. Since CK2$\alpha$ deficient mice are embryonic lethal, this in vitro assay system represents the genetic evidence showing an essential role of CK2$\alpha$ in the mammalian circadian clock. This assay was successfully applied for the phenotype analysis of homozygous mutant ES cells, demonstrating that an ES cell-based in vitro assay is available for circadian genetic screening.},

abstract = {A protein interaction network (PIN) is a set of proteins that modulate one another's activities by regulated synthesis and degradation, by reversible binding to form complexes, and by catalytic reactions (e.g., phosphorylation and dephosphorylation). Most PINs are so complex that their dynamical characteristics cannot be deduced accurately by intuitive reasoning alone. To predict the properties of such networks, many research groups have turned to mathematical models (differential equations based on standard biochemical rate laws, e.g., mass-action, Michaelis-Menten, Hill). When using Michaelis-Menten rate expressions to model PINs, care must be exercised to avoid making inconsistent assumptions about enzyme-substrate complexes. We show that an appealingly simple model of a PIN that functions as a bistable switch is compromised by neglecting enzyme-substrate intermediates. When the neglected intermediates are put back into the model, bistability of the switch is lost. The theory of chemical reaction networks predicts that bistability can be recovered by adding specific reaction channels to the molecular mechanism. We explore two very different routes to recover bistability. In both cases, we show how to convert the original 'phenomenological' model into a consistent set of mass-action rate laws that retains the desired bistability properties. Once an equivalent model is formulated in terms of elementary chemical reactions, it can be simulated accurately either by deterministic differential equations or by Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm.},

We found that both Cry1 and Cry2 proteins are ubiquitinated and degraded via the SCF(Fbxl3) ubiquitin ligase complex. This regulation by SCF(Fbxl3) is a prerequisite for the efficient and timely reactivation of Clock-Bmal1 and the consequent expression of Per1 and Per2, two regulators of the circadian clock that display tumor suppressor activity. Silencing of Fbxl3 produced no effect in Cry1-/-;Cry2-/- cells, which shows that Fbxl3 controls clock oscillations by mediating the degradation of CRY proteins.},

abstract = {The molecular oscillator that keeps circadian time is generated by a negative feedback loop. Nuclear entry of circadian regulatory proteins that inhibit transcription from E-box-containing promoters appears to be a critical component of this loop in both Drosophila and mammals. The Drosophila double-time gene product, a casein kinase I [varepsilon] (CKI[varepsilon]) homolog, has been reported to interact with dPER and regulate circadian cycle length. We find that mammalian CKI[varepsilon] binds to and phosphorylates the murine circadian regulator mPER1. Unlike both dPER and mPER2, mPER1 expressed alone in HEK 293 cells is predominantly a nuclear protein. Two distinct mechanisms appear to retard mPER1 nuclear entry. First, coexpression of mPER2 leads to mPER1-mPER2 heterodimer formation and cytoplasmic colocalization. Second, coexpression of CKI[varepsilon] leads to masking of the mPER1 nuclear localization signal and phosphorylation-dependent cytoplasmic retention of both proteins. CKI[varepsilon] may regulate mammalian circadian rhythm by controlling the rate at which mPER1 enters the nucleus.},

Our results show that when food was introduced during the light period, body temperature peak was not disrupted. In contrast, IF caused almost arrhythmicity in clock gene expression in the liver and advanced mPer2 and mClock expression. However, IF restored the amplitudes of clock gene expression under disruptive light condition regardless whether the animals were calorically restricted or not. Unlike daytime feeding, nighttime feeding yielded rhythms similar to those generated during ad libitum feeding. Taken together, our results show that IF can affect circadian rhythms differently depending on the timing of food availability, and suggest that this regimen induces a metabolic state that affects the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) clock.},

abstract = {Metformin is one of the most commonly used first line drugs for type II diabetes. Metformin lowers serum glucose levels by activating 5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which maintains energy homeostasis by directly sensing the AMP/ATP ratio. AMPK plays a central role in food intake and energy metabolism through its activities in central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Since food intake and energy metabolism is synchronized to the light-dark (LD) cycle of the environment, we investigated the possibility that AMPK may affect circadian rhythm. We discovered that the circadian period of Rat-1 fibroblasts treated with metformin was shortened by 1 h. One of the regulators of the period length is casein kinase Iepsilon (CKIepsilon), which by phosphorylating and inducing the degradation of the circadian clock component, mPer2, shortens the period length. AMPK phosphorylates Ser-389 of CKIepsilon, resulting in increased CKIepsilon activity and degradation of mPer2. In peripheral tissues, injection of metformin leads to mPer2 degradation and a phase advance in the circadian expression pattern of clock genes in wild-type mice but not in AMPK alpha2 knock-out mice. We conclude that metformin and AMPK have a previously unrecognized role in regulating the circadian rhythm.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are internal timekeepers present in almost all organisms. Driven by a genetic network of highly conserved structure, they generate self-sustained oscillations that entrain to periodic external signals such as the 24 h light-dark cycle. Vertebrates possess multiple, functionally overlapping homologues of the core clock genes. Furthermore, vertebrate clocks entrain to a range of periods three times as narrow as that of other organisms. We asked whether genetic redundancies play a role in governing entrainment properties and analysed locomotor activity rhythms of genetically modified mice lacking one set of clock homologues. Exposing them to non-24 h light-dark cycles, we found that the mutant mice have a wider entrainment range than the wild types. Spectral analysis furthermore revealed nonlinear phenomena of periodically forced self-sustained oscillators for which the entrainment range relates inversely to oscillator amplitude. Using the forced oscillator model to explain the observed differences in entrainment range between mutant and wild-type mice, we sought to quantify the overall oscillator amplitude of their clocks from the activity rhythms and found that mutant mice have weaker circadian clocks than wild types. Our results suggest that genetic redundancy strengthens the circadian clock leading to a narrow entrainment range in vertebrates.},

Another major cyclic cellular event, the cell cycle, is regulated by the circadian clock in the few cases where linkage of these cycles has been studied. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, the circadian clock gates cell division by an unknown mechanism. Using timelapse microscopy, we confirm the gating of cell division in the wild-type and demonstrate the regulation of cytokinesis by key clock components. Specifically, a state of the oscillator protein KaiC that is associated with elevated ATPase activity closes the gate by acting through a known clock output pathway to inhibit FtsZ ring formation at the division site. An activity that stimulates KaiC phosphorylation independently of the KaiA protein was also uncovered. We propose a model that separates the functions of KaiC ATPase and phosphorylation in cell division gating and other circadian behaviors.},

Recent studies indicate that genetic alteration in the core molecular clock machinery can have pronounced effects on both peripheral and central metabolic regulatory signals. Many metabolic systems also cycle and may in turn affect function of clock genes and circadian systems. However, little is known about how alterations in energy balance affect the clock. Here we show that a high-fat diet in mice leads to changes in the period of the locomotor activity rhythm and alterations in the expression and cycling of canonical circadian clock genes, nuclear receptors that regulate clock transcription factors, and clock-controlled genes involved in fuel utilization in the hypothalamus, liver, and adipose tissue. These results indicate that consumption of a high-calorie diet alters the function of the mammalian circadian clock.},

To analyze the biochemical processes underlying this flexible-yet-robust characteristic, we examined the effects of 1,260 pharmacologically active compounds in mouse and human clock cell lines. Compounds that markedly (>10 s.d.) lengthened the period in both cell lines, also lengthened it in central clock tissues and peripheral clock cells. Most compounds inhibited casein kinase Iepsilon (CKIepsilon) or CKIdelta phosphorylation of the PER2 protein. Manipulation of CKIepsilon/delta-dependent phosphorylation by these compounds lengthened the period of the mammalian clock from circadian (24 h) to circabidian (48 h), revealing its high sensitivity to chemical perturbation. The degradation rate of PER2, which is regulated by CKIepsilon/delta-dependent phosphorylation, was temperature-insensitive in living clock cells, yet sensitive to chemical perturbations. This temperature-insensitivity was preserved in the CKIepsilon/delta-dependent phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide in vitro. Thus, CKIepsilon/delta-dependent phosphorylation is likely a temperature-insensitive period-determining process in the mammalian circadian clock.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian oscillator is primarily driven by an essential negative feedback loop comprising a positive component, the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex, and a negative component, the PER-CRY complex. Numerous studies suggest that feedback inhibition of CLOCK-BMAL1 is mediated by time-dependent physical interaction with its direct target gene products PER and CRY, suggesting that the ratio between the negative and positive complexes must be important for the molecular oscillator and rhythm generation. We explored this idea by altering expression of clock components in fibroblasts derived from Per2(Luc) and Per mutant mice, a cell system extensively used to study in vivo clock mechanisms. Our data demonstrate that the stoichiometric relationship between clock components is critical for the robustness of circadian rhythms and provide insights into the mechanistic organization of the negative feedback loop. Our findings may explain why certain mutant mice or cells are arrhythmic, whereas others are rhythmic, and suggest that robustness of circadian rhythms can be increased even in wild-type cells by modulating the stoichiometry.},

Partial lesions of the host allow simultaneous expression of both donor and host rhythms. Because partial SCN ablation produces characteristic changes in activity rhythms that are similar to those that occur with age, including shortened period, reduced amplitude, and fragmentation, we investigated the extent to which fetal SCN grafts may be expressed by an animal whose activity rhythm exhibits these age-dependent changes. The results indicate that expression of a transplanted clock is possible in an unlesioned aged host. Grafts of fetal SCN into young hosts and cortical tissue grafts into intact aged hosts have no effect. In those aged animals that received SCN grafts, three patterns of expression emerged in the subsequent locomotor activity record: complete dominance of locomotor rhythmicity by the donor; relative coordination between donor and host rhythms; and spontaneous switching between host and donor phenotypes. The results suggest that the expression of rhythmicity by the grafted SCN may depend on the relative amplitude or strength of signals produced by the host and donor SCN.},

abstract = {Bmal1 is an essential transcriptional activator within the mammalian circadian clock. We report here that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of Bmal1-null mutant mice, unexpectedly, generates stochastic oscillations with periods that overlap the circadian range. Dissociated SCN neurons expressed fluctuating levels of PER2 detected by bioluminescence imaging but could not generate circadian oscillations intrinsically. Inhibition of intercellular communication or cyclic-AMP signaling in SCN slices, which provide a positive feed-forward signal to drive the intracellular negative feedback loop, abolished the stochastic oscillations. Propagation of this feed-forward signal between SCN neurons then promotes quasi-circadian oscillations that arise as an emergent property of the SCN network. Experimental analysis and mathematical modeling argue that both intercellular coupling and molecular noise are required for the stochastic rhythms, providing a novel biological example of noise-induced oscillations. The emergence of stochastic circadian oscillations from the SCN network in the absence of cell-autonomous circadian oscillatory function highlights a previously unrecognized level of circadian organization.},

abstract = {The circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) drives daily rhythms of behavior. Cryptochromes (CRYs) are powerful transcriptional repressors within the molecular negative feedback loops at the heart of the SCN clockwork, where they periodically suppress their own expression and that of clock-controlled genes. To determine the differential contributions of CRY1 and CRY2 within circadian timing in vivo, we exploited the N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced afterhours mutant Fbxl3(Afh) to stabilize endogenous CRY. Importantly, this was conducted in CRY2- and CRY1-deficient mice to test each CRY in isolation. In both CRY-deficient backgrounds, circadian rhythms of wheel-running and SCN bioluminescence showed increased period length with increased Fbxl3(Afh) dosage. Although both CRY proteins slowed the clock, CRY1 was significantly more potent than CRY2, and in SCN slices, CRY1 but not CRY2 prolonged the interval of transcriptional suppression. Selective CRY-stabilization demonstrated that both CRYs are endogenous transcriptional repressors of clock-controlled genes, but again CRY1 was preeminent. Finally, although Cry1(-/-);Cry2(-/-) mice were behaviorally arrhythmic, their SCN expressed short period (∼18 h) rhythms with variable stability. Fbxl3(Afh/Afh) had no effect on these CRY-independent rhythms, confirming its circadian action is mediated exclusively via CRYs. Thus, stabilization of both CRY1 and CRY2 are necessary and sufficient to explain circadian period lengthening by Fbxl3(Afh/Afh). Both CRY proteins dose-dependently lengthen the intrinsic, high-frequency SCN rhythm, and CRY2 also attenuates the more potent period-lengthening effects of CRY1. Incorporation of CRY-mediated transcriptional feedback thus confers stability to intrinsic SCN oscillations, establishing periods between 18 and 29 h, as determined by selective contributions of CRY1 and CRY2.},

To quantify these rhythms, which show significant variation and large non-stationarities (damping and baseline drifting), we developed a new fast Fourier transform-nonlinear least squares analysis procedure that specifically optimizes the quantification of amplitude for circadian rhythm data. This enhanced analysis method successfully distinguishes among the ten signaling compounds for their rhythm-inducing properties. We pursued detailed analyses of the responses to two of these compounds that induced the highest amplitude rhythms in fibroblasts, forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase), and dexamethasone (an agonist of glucocorticoid receptors). Our quantitative analyses clearly indicate that the synchronization mechanisms by the cAMP and glucocorticoid pathways are different, implying that actions of different genes stimulated by these pathways lead to distinctive programs of circadian synchronization.},

Deregulation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, which are essential for glucose homeostasis, often results in obesity and diabetes. Thus, these pathways should be attractive therapeutic targets. However, with the exception of metformin, which is considered to function mainly by activating AMPK, no treatment for the metabolic syndrome based on targeting protein kinases has yet been developed. By contrast, therapies based on the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways are already successful in the treatment of diverse cancer types and inflammatory diseases. This contradiction prompted us to review the signal transduction mechanisms of PI3K/AKT, MAPK and AMPK and their roles in glucose homeostasis, and we also discuss current clinical implications.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a master pacemaker in neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and clocks of a similar molecular makeup in most peripheral body cells. Peripheral oscillators are self-sustained and cell autonomous, but they have to be synchronized by the SCN to ensure phase coherence within the organism. In principle, the rhythmic expression of genes in peripheral organs could thus be driven not only by local oscillators, but also by circadian systemic signals. To discriminate between these mechanisms, we engineered a mouse strain with a conditionally active liver clock, in which REV-ERBalpha represses the transcription of the essential core clock gene Bmal1 in a doxycycline-dependent manner. We examined circadian liver gene expression genome-wide in mice in which hepatocyte oscillators were either running or arrested, and found that the rhythmic transcription of most genes depended on functional hepatocyte clocks. However, we discovered 31 genes, including the core clock gene mPer2, whose expression oscillated robustly irrespective of whether the liver clock was running or not. By contrast, in liver explants cultured in vitro, circadian cycles of mPer2::luciferase bioluminescence could only be observed when hepatocyte oscillators were operational. Hence, the circadian cycles observed in the liver of intact animals without functional hepatocyte oscillators were likely generated by systemic signals. The finding that rhythmic mPer2 expression can be driven by both systemic cues and local oscillators suggests a plausible mechanism for the phase entrainment of subsidiary clocks in peripheral organs.},

abstract = {The Drosophila shaggy gene product is a mammalian glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) homologue that contributes to the circadian clock of the Drosophila through TIMELESS phosphorylation, and it regulates nuclear translocation of the PERIOD/TIMELESS heterodimer. We found that mammalian GSK-3beta is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and liver of mice and that GSK-3beta phosphorylation exhibits robust circadian oscillation. Rhythmic GSK-3beta phosphorylation is also observed in serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells. Exposing serum-shocked NIH3T3 cells to lithium chloride, a specific inhibitor of GSK-3beta, increases GSK-3beta phosphorylation and delays the phase of rhythmic clock gene expression. On the other hand, GSK-3beta overexpression advances the phase of clock gene expression. We also found that GSK-3beta interacts with PERIOD2 (PER2) in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant GSK-3beta can phosphorylate PER2 in vitro. GSK-3beta promotes the nuclear translocation of PER2 in COS1 cells. The present data suggest that GSK-3beta plays important roles in mammalian circadian clock.},

abstract = {In multicellular organisms, circadian oscillators are organized into multitissue systems which function as biological clocks that regulate the activities of the organism in relation to environmental cycles and provide an internal temporal framework. To investigate the organization of a mammalian circadian system, we constructed a transgenic rat line in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the mouse Per1 promoter. Light emission from cultured suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of these rats was invariably and robustly rhythmic and persisted for up to 32 days in vitro. Liver, lung, and skeletal muscle also expressed circadian rhythms, which damped after two to seven cycles in vitro. In response to advances and delays of the environmental light cycle, the circadian rhythm of light emission from the SCN shifted more rapidly than did the rhythm of locomotor behavior or the rhythms in peripheral tissues. We hypothesize that a self-sustained circadian pacemaker in the SCN entrains circadian oscillators in the periphery to maintain adaptive phase control, which is temporarily lost following large, abrupt shifts in the environmental light cycle.},

abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus governs daily variations of physiology and behavior in mammals. Within single neurons, interlocked transcriptional/translational feedback loops generate circadian rhythms on the molecular level. We present a mathematical model that reflects the essential features of the mammalian circadian oscillator to characterize the differential roles of negative and positive feedback loops. The oscillations that are obtained have a 24-h period and are robust toward parameter variations even when the positive feedback is replaced by a constantly expressed activator. This demonstrates the crucial role of the negative feedback for rhythm generation. Moreover, it explains the rhythmic phenotype of Rev-erbalpha-/- mutant mice, where a positive feedback is missing. The interplay of negative and positive feedback reveals a complex dynamics. In particular, the model explains the unexpected rescue of circadian oscillations in Per2Brdm1/Cry2-/- double-mutant mice (Per2Brdm1 single-mutant mice are arrhythmic). Here, a decrease of positive feedback strength associated with mutating the Per2 gene is compensated by the Cry2-/- mutation that simultaneously decreases the negative feedback strength. Finally, this model leads us to a testable prediction of a molecular and behavioral phenotype: circadian oscillations should be rescued when arrhythmic Per2Brdm1 mutant mice are crossed with Rev- erbalpha -/- mutant mice.},

abstract = {Many biochemical events within a cell need to be timed properly to occur at specific times of day, after other events have happened within the cell or in response to environmental signals. The cellular biochemical feedback loops that time these events have already received much recent attention in the experimental and modeling communities. Here, we show how ideas from signal processing can be applied to understand the function of these clocks. Consider two signals from the network s(t) and r(t), either two variables of a model or two experimentally measured time courses. We show how s(t) can be decomposed into two parts, the first being a function of r(t), and the second the derivative of a function of r(t). Geometric principles are then derived that can be used to understand when oscillations appear in biochemical feedback loops, the period of these oscillations, and their time course. Specific examples of this theory are provided that show how certain networks are prone or not prone to oscillate, how individual biochemical processes affect the period, and how oscillations in one chemical species can be deduced from oscillations in other parts of the network.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks coordinate behavior and physiology with daily environmental cycles and thereby optimize the timing of metabolic processes such as glucose production and insulin secretion. Such circadian regulation of metabolism provides an adaptive advantage in diverse organisms. Mammalian clocks are primarily based on a transcription and translation feedback loop in which a heterodimeric complex of the transcription factors CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and BMAL1 (brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1) activates the expression of its own repressors, the period (PER1-3) and cryptochrome (CRY1 and CRY2) proteins. Posttranslational modification of these core clock components is critical for setting clock time or adjusting the speed of the clock. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is one of several metabolic sensors that have been reported to transmit energy-dependent signals to the mammalian clock. AMPK does so by driving the phosphorylation and destabilization of CRY and PER proteins. In addition, AMPK subunit composition, sub-cellular localization, and substrate phosphorylation are dependent on clock time. Given the well-established role of AMPK in diverse aspects of metabolic physiology, the reciprocal regulation of AMPK and circadian clocks likely plays an important role in circadian metabolic regulation.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms result from feedback loops involving clock genes and their protein products. In mammals, 2 orphan nuclear receptors, REV-ERBalpha and RORalpha, play important roles in the transcription of the clock gene Bmal1. The authors now considerably extend these findings with the demonstration that all members of the REV-ERB (alpha and beta) and ROR (alpha, beta, and gamma) families repress and activate Bmal1 transcription, respectively. The authors further show that transcription of Bmal1 is the result of competition between REV-ERBs and RORs at their specific response elements (RORE). Moreover, they demonstrate that Reverb genes are similarly expressed in the thymus, skeletal muscle, and kidney, whereas Ror genes present distinct expression patterns. Thus, the results indicate that all members of the REV-ERB and ROR families are crucial components of the molecular circadian clock. Furthermore, their strikingly different patterns of expression in nervous and peripheral tissues provide important insights into functional differences between circadian clocks within the organism.},

abstract = {The circadian clock acts at the genomic level to coordinate internal behavioural and physiological rhythms via the CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional heterodimer. Although the nuclear receptors REV-ERB-$\alpha$ and REV-ERB-$\beta$ have been proposed to form an accessory feedback loop that contributes to clock function, their precise roles and importance remain unresolved. To establish their regulatory potential, we determined the genome-wide cis-acting targets (cistromes) of both REV-ERB isoforms in murine liver, which revealed shared recognition at over 50\% of their total DNA binding sites and extensive overlap with the master circadian regulator BMAL1. Although REV-ERB-$\alpha$ has been shown to regulate Bmal1 expression directly, our cistromic analysis reveals a more profound connection between BMAL1 and the REV-ERB-$\alpha$ and REV-ERB-$\beta$ genomic regulatory circuits than was previously suspected. Genes within the intersection of the BMAL1, REV-ERB-$\alpha$ and REV-ERB-$\beta$ cistromes are highly enriched for both clock and metabolic functions. As predicted by the cistromic analysis, dual depletion of Rev-erb-$\alpha$ and Rev-erb-$\beta$ function by creating double-knockout mice profoundly disrupted circadian expression of core circadian clock and lipid homeostatic gene networks. As a result, double-knockout mice show markedly altered circadian wheel-running behaviour and deregulated lipid metabolism. These data now unite REV-ERB-$\alpha$ and REV-ERB-$\beta$ with PER, CRY and other components of the principal feedback loop that drives circadian expression and indicate a more integral mechanism for the coordination of circadian rhythm and metabolism.},

abstract = {The core oscillator generating circadian rhythms in eukaryotes is composed of transcription--translation-based autoregulatory feedback loops in which clock gene products negatively affect their own expression. A key step in this mechanism involves the periodic nuclear accumulation of clock proteins following their mRNA rhythms after approximately 6 h delay. Nuclear accumulation of mPER2 is promoted by mCRY proteins. Here, using COS7 cells and mCry1/mCry2 double mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts transiently expressing GFP-tagged (mutant) mPER2, we show that the protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm using functional nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences. Moreover, we provide evidence that mCRY proteins prevent ubiquitylation of mPER2 and subsequent degradation of the latter protein by the proteasome system. Interestingly, mPER2 in turn prevents ubiquitylation and degradation of mCRY proteins. On the basis of these data we propose a model in which shuttling mPER2 is ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome unless it is retained in the nucleus by mCRY proteins.},

abstract = {With the use of a molecular model for circadian rhythms in Drosophila based on transcriptional regulation, we show how a single, critical pulse of light can permanently suppress circadian rhythmicity, whereas a second light pulse can restore the abolished rhythm. The phenomena occur via the pulsatile induction of either protein degradation or gene expression in conditions in which a stable steady state coexists with stable circadian oscillations of the limit cycle type. The model indicates that suppression by a light pulse can only be accounted for by assuming that the biochemical effects of such a pulse much outlast its actual duration. We determine the characteristics of critical pulses suppressing the oscillations as a function of the phase at which the rhythm is perturbed. The model predicts how the amplitude and duration of the biochemical changes induced by critical pulses vary with this phase. The results provide a molecular, dynamic explanation for the long-term suppression of circadian rhythms observed in a variety of organisms in response to a single light pulse and for the subsequent restoration of the rhythms by a second light pulse.},

Here, the authors show that the F-box protein beta-transducin repeat containing protein 1 (beta-TrCP1) as part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is an essential component of the mammalian circadian oscillator. Down-regulation of endogenous beta-TrCP1 as well as expression of a dominant-negative form both result in lengthening of the circadian period in oscillating fibroblasts. These phenotypes are due to an impaired degradation of PERIOD (PER) proteins, since expression of beta-TrCP interaction-deficient PER2 variants--but not wild-type PER2--results in a dramatic stabilization of PER2 protein as well as in the disruption of circadian rhythmicity. Mathematical modeling conceptualizes the authors' findings and suggests that loss of sustained rhythmicity in cells with eliminated beta-TrCP-mediated PER2 degradation is due to excessive nuclear repression, a prediction they verified experimentally.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are endogenous cycles with periods close to, but not exactly equal to, 24 h. In mammals, circadian rhythms are generated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus as well as several peripheral cell types, such as fibroblasts. Protein kinases are key regulators of the circadian molecular machinery. We investigated the role of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), which belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinases family, in the regulation of circadian rhythms. In rat-1 fibroblasts, the p46 kDa, but not the p54 kDa, isoforms of JNK expressed circadian rhythms in phosphorylation. The JNK-inhibitor SP600125 dose-dependently extended the period of Period1-luciferase rhythms in rat-1 fibroblasts from 24.23+/-0.17-31.48+/-0.07 h. This treatment also dose-dependently delayed the onset of the bioluminescence rhythms. The effects of SP600125 on explant cultures from Period1-luciferase transgenic mice and Period2(Luciferase) knockin mice appeared tissue-specific. SP600125 lengthened the period in SCN, pineal gland, and lung explants in Period1-luciferase and Period2(Luciferase) mice. However, in the kidneys circadian rhythms were abolished in Period1-luciferase, while circadian rhythms were not affected by SP600125 treatment in Period2(Luciferase) mice. Valproic acid, already known to affect period length, enhanced JNK phosphorylation and, as predicted, shortened the period of the Period1-bioluminescence rhythms in rat-1 fibroblasts. In conclusion, our results showed that SP600125 treatment, as well as valproic acid, alters JNK phosphorylation levels, and modulates the period length in various tissues. We conclude that JNK phosphorylation levels may help to set the period length of mammalian circadian rhythms.},

abstract = {Many metabolic and physiological processes display circadian oscillations. We have shown that the core circadian regulator, CLOCK, is a histone acetyltransferase whose activity is counterbalanced by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1. Here we show that intracellular NAD+ levels cycle with a 24-hour rhythm, an oscillation driven by the circadian clock. CLOCK:BMAL1 regulates the circadian expression of NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), an enzyme that provides a rate-limiting step in the NAD+ salvage pathway. SIRT1 is recruited to the Nampt promoter and contributes to the circadian synthesis of its own coenzyme. Using the specific inhibitor FK866, we demonstrated that NAMPT is required to modulate circadian gene expression. Our findings in mouse embryo fibroblasts reveal an interlocked transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop that governs the molecular interplay between cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms.},

abstract = {Michaelis-Menten kinetics are commonly used to represent enzyme-catalysed reactions in biochemical models. The Michaelis-Menten approximation has been thoroughly studied in the context of traditional differential equation models. The presence of small concentrations in biochemical systems, however, encourages the conversion to a discrete stochastic representation. It is shown that the Michaelis-Menten approximation is applicable in discrete stochastic models and that the validity conditions are the same as in the deterministic regime. The authors then compare the Michaelis-Menten approximation to a procedure called the slow-scale stochastic simulation algorithm (ssSSA). The theory underlying the ssSSA implies a formula that seems in some cases to be different from the well-known Michaelis-Menten formula. Here those differences are examined, and some special cases of the stochastic formulas are confirmed using a first-passage time analysis. This exercise serves to place the conventional Michaelis-Menten formula in a broader rigorous theoretical framework.},

abstract = {Lithium salt has been widely used in treatment of Bipolar Disorder, a mental disturbance associated with circadian rhythm disruptions. Lithium mildly but consistently lengthens circadian period of behavioural rhythms in multiple organisms. To systematically address the impacts of lithium on circadian pacemaking and the underlying mechanisms, we measured locomotor activity in mice in vivo following chronic lithium treatment, and also tracked clock protein dynamics (PER2::Luciferase) in vitro in lithium-treated tissue slices/cells. Lithium lengthens period of both the locomotor activity rhythms, as well as the molecular oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, lung tissues and fibroblast cells. In addition, we also identified significantly elevated PER2::LUC expression and oscillation amplitude in both central and peripheral pacemakers. Elevation of PER2::LUC by lithium was not associated with changes in protein stabilities of PER2, but instead with increased transcription of Per2 gene. Although lithium and GSK3 inhibition showed opposing effects on clock period, they acted in a similar fashion to up-regulate PER2 expression and oscillation amplitude. Collectively, our data have identified a novel amplitude-enhancing effect of lithium on the PER2 protein rhythms in the central and peripheral circadian clockwork, which may involve a GSK3-mediated signalling pathway. These findings may advance our understanding of the therapeutic actions of lithium in Bipolar Disorder or other psychiatric diseases that involve circadian rhythm disruptions.},

The molecules, cells and networks that underlie these circadian rhythms can now be monitored using long-term cellular imaging and electrophysiological tools, and initial studies have already suggested a theme--circadian clocks may be crucial for widespread changes in brain activity and plasticity. These daily changes can modify the amount or activity of available genes, transcripts, proteins, ions and other biologically active molecules, ultimately determining cellular properties such as excitability and connectivity. Recently discovered circadian molecules and cells provide preliminary insights into a network that adapts to predictable daily and seasonal changes while remaining robust in the face of other perturbations.},

Unlike the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock that is set by light and drives rest-activity and fasting-feeding cycles, peripheral clocks are set by daily feeding, suggesting that at least some contribute metabolic regulation. The liver plays a well known role in glucose homeostasis, and we report here that mice with a liver-specific deletion of Bmal1, an essential clock component, exhibited hypoglycemia restricted to the fasting phase of the daily feeding cycle, exaggerated glucose clearance, and loss of rhythmic expression of hepatic glucose regulatory genes. We conclude that the liver clock is important for buffering circulating glucose in a time-of-day-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the liver clock contributes to homeostasis by driving a daily rhythm of hepatic glucose export that counterbalances the daily cycle of glucose ingestion resulting from the fasting-feeding cycle.},

abstract = {Period determination in the mammalian circadian clock involves the turnover rate of the repressors CRY and PER. We show that CRY ubiquitination engages two competing E3 ligase complexes that either lengthen or shorten circadian period in mice. Cloning of a short-period circadian mutant, Past-time, revealed a glycine to glutamate missense mutation in Fbxl21, an F-box protein gene that is a paralog of Fbxl3 that targets the CRY proteins for degradation. While loss of function of FBXL3 leads to period lengthening, mutation of Fbxl21 causes period shortening. FBXL21 forms an SCF E3 ligase complex that slowly degrades CRY in the cytoplasm but antagonizes the stronger E3 ligase activity of FBXL3 in the nucleus. FBXL21 plays a dual role: protecting CRY from FBXL3 degradation in the nucleus and promoting CRY degradation within the cytoplasm. Thus, the balance and cellular compartmentalization of competing E3 ligases for CRY determine circadian period of the clock in mammals.},

abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

Since the in vitro reconstruction of the Kai oscillator, the structures and functions of the Kai proteins have been studied extensively. Each protein's crystal structure and low-resolution views of Kai complexes have been reported. In addition, newer data are emerging on dynamic aspects such as assembly/disassembly of the Kai components and a ticking motion of KaiC, which is probably coupled to its slow, temperature-compensated ATPase activity. The accumulated evidence offers an ideal opportunity to revisit a fundamental question regarding biological circadian clocks: what determines the temperature-compensated 24 h period?

abstract = {The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a master circadian pacemaker. It is not known which SCN neurons are autonomous pacemakers or how they synchronize their daily firing rhythms to coordinate circadian behavior. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and the VIP receptor VPAC(2) (encoded by the gene Vipr2) may mediate rhythms in individual SCN neurons, synchrony between neurons, or both. We found that Vip(-/-) and Vipr2(-/-) mice showed two daily bouts of activity in a skeleton photoperiod and multiple circadian periods in constant darkness. Loss of VIP or VPAC(2) also abolished circadian firing rhythms in approximately half of all SCN neurons and disrupted synchrony between rhythmic neurons. Critically, daily application of a VPAC(2) agonist restored rhythmicity and synchrony to VIP(-/-) SCN neurons, but not to Vipr2(-/-) neurons. We conclude that VIP coordinates daily rhythms in the SCN and behavior by synchronizing a small population of pacemaking neurons and maintaining rhythmicity in a larger subset of neurons.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks regulate behavioral, physiological and biochemical processes in a day/night cycle. Circadian oscillators have an essential role in the coordination of physiological processes with the cyclic changes in the physical environment. Such mammalian circadian clocks composed of the positive components (BMAL1 and CLOCK) and the negative components (CRY and PERIOD (PER)) are regulated by a negative transcriptional feedback loop in which PER is rate-limiting for feedback inhibition. In addition, posttranslational modification of these components is critical for setting or resetting the circadian oscillation. Circadian regulation of metabolism is mediated through reciprocal signaling between the clock and metabolic regulatory networks. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the brain and peripheral tissue is a crucial cellular energy sensor that has a role in metabolic control. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of CRY and Casein kinases I regulates the negative feedback control of circadian clock by proteolytic degradation. AMPK can also modulate the circadian rhythms through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent regulation of silent information regulator 1. Growing evidence elucidates the AMPK-mediated controls of circadian clock in metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. In this review, we summarize the current comprehension of AMPK-mediated regulation of the circadian rhythms. This will provide insight into understanding how their components regulate the metabolism.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The phase response curve (PRC) is a powerful tool to study the effect of a perturbation on the phase of an oscillator, assuming that all the dynamics can be explained by the phase variable. However, factors like the rate of convergence to the oscillator, strong forcing or high stimulation frequency may invalidate the above assumption and raise the question of how is the phase variation away from an attractor. The concept of isochrons turns out to be crucial to answer this question; from it, we have built up Phase Response Functions (PRF) and, in the present paper, we complete the extension of advancement functions to the transient states by defining the Amplitude Response Function (ARF) to control changes in the transversal variables. Based on the knowledge of both the PRF and the ARF, we study the case of a pulse-train stimulus, and compare the predictions given by the PRC-approach (a 1D map) to those given by the PRF-ARF-approach (a 2D map); we observe differences up to two orders of magnitude in favor of the 2D predictions, especially when the stimulation frequency is high or the strength of the stimulus is large. We also explore the role of hyperbolicity of the limit cycle as well as geometric aspects of the isochrons. Summing up, we aim at enlightening the contribution of transient effects in predicting the phase response and showing the limits of the phase reduction approach to prevent from falling into wrong predictions in synchronization problems.

Nineteen clock mutations were mapped to the three kai genes. Promoter activities upstream of the kaiA and kaiB genes showed circadian rhythms of expression, and both kaiA and kaiBC messenger RNAs displayed circadian cycling. Inactivation of any single kai gene abolished these rhythms and reduced kaiBC-promoter activity. Continuous kaiC overexpression repressed the kaiBC promoter, whereas kaiA overexpression enhanced it. Temporal kaiC overexpression reset the phase of the rhythms. Thus, a negative feedback control of kaiC expression by KaiC generates a circadian oscillation in cyanobacteria, and KaiA sustains the oscillation by enhancing kaiC expression.},

abstract = {Just as the Wright brothers implemented controls to achieve stable airplane flight, flying insects have evolved behavioral strategies that ensure recovery from flight disturbances. Pioneering studies performed on tethered and dissected insects demonstrate that the sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems play important roles in flight control. Such studies, however, cannot produce an integrative model of insect flight stability because they do not incorporate the interaction of these systems with free-flight aerodynamics. We directly investigate control and stability through the application of torque impulses to freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and measurement of their behavioral response. High-speed video and a new motion tracking method capture the aerial "stumble," and we discover that flies respond to gentle disturbances by accurately returning to their original orientation. These insects take advantage of a stabilizing aerodynamic influence and active torque generation to recover their heading to within 2 degrees in < 60 ms. To explain this recovery behavior, we form a feedback control model that includes the fly's ability to sense body rotations, process this information, and actuate the wing motions that generate corrective aerodynamic torque. Thus, like early man-made aircraft and modern fighter jets, the fruit fly employs an automatic stabilization scheme that reacts to short time-scale disturbances.},

Then, how do circadian clocks operate properly in varying weather and seasons? In this paper, we discuss the strategy unveiled by recent studies of the circadian clock of Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living eukaryotic organism. It combines mechanisms controlling light inputs and clock sensitivity, shaping both the dynamics of the core circadian oscillator and its forcing by light so as to ensure stable and precise synchronization in all weather and seasons.},

@article{Hirota2004,
abstract = {Almost all organisms on earth exhibit diurnal rhythms in physiology and behavior under the control of autonomous time-measuring system called circadian clock. The circadian clock is generally reset by environmental time cues, such as light, in order to synchronize with the external 24-h cycles. In mammals, the core oscillator of the circadian clock is composed of transcription/translation-based negative feedback loops regulating the cyclic expression of a limited number of clock genes (such as Per, Cry, Bmal1, etc.) and hundreds of output genes in a well-concerted manner. The central clock controlling the behavioral rhythm is localized in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and peripheral clocks are present in other various tissues. The phase of the central clock is amenable to ambient light signal captured by the visual rod-cone photoreceptors and non-visual melanopsin in the retina. These light signals are transmitted to the SCN through the retinohypothalamic tract, and transduced therein by mitogen-activated protein kinase and other signaling molecules to induce Per gene expression, which eventually elicits phase-dependent phase shifts of the clock. The central clock controls peripheral clocks directly and indirectly by virtue of neural, humoral, and other signals in a coordinated manner. The change in feeding time resets the peripheral clocks in a SCN-independent manner, possibly by food metabolites and body temperature rhythms. In this article, we will provide an overview of recent molecular and genetic studies on the resetting mechanism of the central and peripheral circadian clocks in mammals.},

To test whether insulin acts as a synchronizer for the hepatic clock by cell-autonomous mechanisms, the phase-resetting capabilities of insulin were investigated in cultured hepatic cells. We provide evidence that three-dimensional (3D) cell culture conditions that preserve the differentiated state of primary hepatocytes sustained the robustness of the molecular clock, while this robustness rapidly dampened under classical monolayer cell culture conditions. Herein, we established a 3D cell culture system coupled with a real-time luciferase reporter, and demonstrated that insulin directly regulates the phase entrainment of hepatocyte circadian oscillators. We found that insulin-deficient diabetic rats had a pronounced phase advance in their hepatic clock. Subsequently, a single administration of insulin induced phase-dependent bi-directional phase shifts in diabetic rat livers. Our results clearly demonstrate that insulin is a liver clock synchronizer.},

@article{An2013,
abstract = {Shift work or transmeridian travel can desynchronize the body's circadian rhythms from local light-dark cycles. The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) generates and entrains daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. Paradoxically, we found that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a neuropeptide implicated in synchrony among SCN cells, can also desynchronize them. The degree and duration of desynchronization among SCN neurons depended on both the phase and the dose of VIP. A model of the SCN consisting of coupled stochastic cells predicted both the phase- and the dose-dependent response to VIP and that the transient phase desynchronization, or "phase tumbling", could arise from intrinsic, stochastic noise in small populations of key molecules (notably, Period mRNA near its daily minimum). The model also predicted that phase tumbling following brief VIP treatment would accelerate entrainment to shifted environmental cycles. We tested this using a prepulse of VIP during the day before a shift in either a light cycle in vivo or a temperature cycle in vitro. Although VIP during the day does not shift circadian rhythms, the VIP pretreatment approximately halved the time required for mice to reentrain to an 8-h shifted light schedule and for SCN cultures to reentrain to a 10-h shifted temperature cycle. We conclude that VIP below 100 nM synchronizes SCN cells and above 100 nM reduces synchrony in the SCN. We show that exploiting these mechanisms that transiently reduce cellular synchrony before a large shift in the schedule of daily environmental cues has the potential to reduce jet lag.},

@article{Stricker2008,
abstract = {One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches and oscillators, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development and cellular population control. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.},

abstract = {The cell-cycle oscillator includes an essential negative-feedback loop: Cdc2 activates the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which leads to cyclin destruction and Cdc2 inactivation. Under some circumstances, a negative-feedback loop is sufficient to generate sustained oscillations. However, the Cdc2/APC system also includes positive-feedback loops, whose functional importance we now assess. We show that short-circuiting positive feedback makes the oscillations in Cdc2 activity faster, less temporally abrupt, and damped. This compromises the activation of cyclin destruction and interferes with mitotic exit and DNA replication. This work demonstrates a systems-level role for positive-feedback loops in the embryonic cell cycle and provides an example of how oscillations can emerge out of combinations of subcircuits whose individual behaviors are not oscillatory. This work also underscores the fundamental similarity of cell-cycle oscillations in embryos to repetitive action potentials in pacemaker neurons, with both systems relying on a combination of negative and positive-feedback loops.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms in mammals are generated by a negative transcriptional feedback loop in which PERIOD (PER) is rate-limiting for feedback inhibition. Casein kinases Idelta and Iepsilon (CKIdelta/epsilon) can regulate temporal abundance/activity of PER by phosphorylation-mediated degradation and cellular localization. Despite their potentially crucial effects on PER, it has not been demonstrated in a mammalian system that these kinases play essential roles in circadian rhythm generation as does their homolog in Drosophila. To disrupt both CKIdelta/epsilon while avoiding the embryonic lethality of CKIdelta disruption in mice, we used CKIdelta-deficient Per2(Luc) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant CKIepsilon (DN-CKIepsilon) in the mutant MEFs. CKIdelta-deficient MEFs exhibited a robust circadian rhythm, albeit with a longer period, suggesting that the cells possess a way to compensate for CKIdelta loss. When CKIepsilon activity was disrupted by the DN-CKIepsilon in the mutant MEFs, circadian bioluminescence rhythms were eliminated and rhythms in endogenous PER abundance and phosphorylation were severely compromised, demonstrating that CKIdelta/epsilon are indeed essential kinases for the clockwork. This is further supported by abolition of circadian rhythms when physical interaction between PER and CKIdelta/epsilon was disrupted by overexpressing the CKIdelta/epsilon binding domain of PER2 (CKBD-P2). Interestingly, CKBD-P2 overexpression led to dramatically low levels of endogenous PER, while PER-binding, kinase-inactive DN-CKIepsilon did not, suggesting that CKIdelta/epsilon may have a non-catalytic role in stabilizing PER. Our results show that an essential role of CKIdelta/epsilon is conserved between Drosophila and mammals, but CKIdelta/epsilon and DBT may have divergent non-catalytic functions in the clockwork as well.},

abstract = {With the development of new interdisciplinary fields such as systems biology, the quantitative analysis of protein expression in biological samples gains more and more importance. Although the most common method for this is ELISA, Western blot also has advantages: The separation of proteins by size allows the evaluation of only specifically bound protein. This work examines the Western blot signal chain, determines some of the parameters relevant for quantitative analysis and proposes a mathematical model of the reaction kinetics. Using this model, a semiquantitative Western blot method for simultaneous quantification of different proteins using a hyperbolic calibration curve was developed. A program was written for the purpose of hyperbolic regression that allows quick determination of the calibration curve coefficients. This program can be used also for approximation of calibration curves in other applications such as ELISA, BCA or Bradford assays.},

@article{Singh2012,
abstract = {Within individual cells, two molecular processes have been implicated as sources of noise in gene expression: (i) Poisson fluctuations in mRNA abundance arising from random birth and death of individual mRNA transcripts or (ii) promoter fluctuations arising from stochastic promoter transitions between different transcriptional states. Steady-state measurements of variance in protein levels are insufficient to discriminate between these two mechanisms, and mRNA single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) is challenging when cellular mRNA concentrations are high. Here, we present a perturbation method that discriminates mRNA birth/death fluctuations from promoter fluctuations by measuring transient changes in protein variance and that can operate in the regime of high molecular numbers. Conceptually, the method exploits the fact that transcriptional blockage results in more rapid increases in protein variability when mRNA birth/death fluctuations dominate over promoter fluctuations. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this perturbation approach in the HIV-1 model system. Our results support promoter fluctuations as the primary noise source in HIV-1 expression. This study illustrates a relatively simple method that complements mRNA smFISH hybridization and can be used with existing GFP-tagged libraries to include or exclude alternate sources of noise in gene expression.},

@article{Rohling2011,
abstract = {The circadian pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) contains a major pacemaker for 24 h rhythms that is synchronized to the external light-dark cycle. In response to a shift in the external cycle, neurons of the SCN resynchronize with different pace. We performed electrical activity recordings of the SCN of rats in vitro following a 6 hour delay of the light-dark cycle and observed a bimodal electrical activity pattern with a shifted and an unshifted component. The shifted component was relatively narrow as compared to the unshifted component (2.2 h and 5.7 h, respectively). Curve fitting and simulations predicted that less than 30\% of the neurons contribute to the shifted component and that their phase distribution is small. This prediction was confirmed by electrophysiological recordings of neuronal subpopulations. Only 25\% of the neurons exhibited an immediate shift in the phase of the electrical activity rhythms, and the phases of the shifted subpopulations appeared significantly more synchronized as compared to the phases of the unshifted subpopulations (p<0.05). We also performed electrical activity recordings of the SCN following a 9 hour advance of the light-dark cycle. The phase advances induced a large desynchrony among the neurons, but consistent with the delays, only 19\% of the neurons peaked at the mid of the new light phase. The data suggest that resetting of the central circadian pacemaker to both delays and advances is brought about by an initial shift of a relatively small group of neurons that becomes highly synchronized following a shift in the external cycle. The high degree of synchronization of the shifted neurons may add to the ability of this group to reset the pacemaker. The large desynchronization observed following advances may contribute to the relative difficulty of the circadian system to respond to advanced light cycles.},

abstract = {The oscillator of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria is composed of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a self-sustained ∼24-h rhythm of phosphorylation of KaiC. The mechanism propelling this oscillator has remained elusive, however. We show that stacking interactions between the CI and CII rings of KaiC drive the transition from the phosphorylation-specific KaiC-KaiA interaction to the dephosphorylation-specific KaiC-KaiB interaction. We have identified the KaiB-binding site, which is on the CI domain. This site is hidden when CI domains are associated as a hexameric ring. However, stacking of the CI and CII rings exposes the KaiB-binding site. Because the clock output protein SasA also binds to CI and competes with KaiB for binding, ring stacking likely regulates clock output. We demonstrate that ADP can expose the KaiB-binding site in the absence of ring stacking, providing an explanation for how it can reset the clock.},

In addition, peripheral organs expressed tissue-specific differences in circadian period and phase. Surprisingly, lesions of the SCN in mPer2(Luciferase) knockin mice did not abolish circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues, but instead caused phase desynchrony among the tissues of individual animals and from animal to animal. These results demonstrate that peripheral tissues express self-sustained, rather than damped, circadian oscillations and suggest the existence of organ-specific synchronizers of circadian rhythms at the cell and tissue level.},

abstract = {The mammalian SCN contains a biological clock that drives remarkably precise circadian rhythms in vivo and in vitro. This study asks whether the cycle-to-cycle variability of behavioral rhythms in mice can be attributed to precision of individual circadian pacemakers within the SCN or their interactions. The authors measured the standard deviation of the cycle-to-cycle period from 7-day recordings of running wheel activity, Period1 gene expression in cultured SCN explants, and firing rate patterns of dispersed SCN neurons. Period variability of the intact tissue and animal was lower than single neurons. The median variability of running wheel and Period1 rhythms was less than 40 min per cycle compared to 2.1 h in firing rate rhythms of dispersed SCN neurons. The most precise SCN neuron, with a period deviation of 1.1 h, was 10 times noisier than the most accurate SCN explant (0.1 h) or mouse (0.1 h) but comparable to the least stable explant (2.1 h) and mouse (1.1 h). This variability correlated with intrinsic period in mice and SCN explants but not with single cells. Precision was unrelated to the amplitude of rhythms and did not change significantly with age up to 1 year after birth. Analysis of the serial correlation of cycle-to-cycle period revealed that approximately half of this variability is attributable to noise outside the pacemaker. These results indicate that cell-cell interactions within the SCN reduce pacemaker noise to determine the precision of circadian rhythms in the tissue and in behavior.},

A dual requirement for CREB phosphorylation and CRTC dephosphorylation is likely to explain how these activator-co-activator cognates discriminate between different stimuli. Following their activation, CREB and CRTCs mediate the effects of fasting and feeding signals on the expression of metabolic programmes in insulin-sensitive tissues.},

abstract = {The notion of identifiability addresses the question of whether it is at all possible to obtain unique solutions for unknown parameters of interest in a mathematical model, from data collected in well-defined stimulus-response experiments performed on a dynamic system represented by the model. This critical aspect of the modeling and data reduction problem is reviewed, analyzed, and unified, with emphasis on applications in biology. Several physiological system models are examined in detail. They illustrate the importance of identifiability analysis prior to performing a parameter estimation experiment, the algebraic difficulties, possible pitfalls, and not-so-apparent ambiguities that may be encountered--even for simple models--and the utility of the concept in experiment design. Methods for testing for identifiability also are reviewed and compared, with emphasis on applicability and limitations. The usefulness of a given model for predicting the time course of system variables (not parameters) of interest normally inaccessible to direct measurement (e.g., tissue concentrations), a common use for quantitative models, is shown to depend intimately on the identifiability properties of the model, in a manner not easy but essential to assess: state variable predictions made in this manner can be inherently ambiguous.},

abstract = {Vital physiological behaviors exhibited daily by bacteria, plants, and animals are governed by endogenous oscillators called circadian clocks. The most salient feature of the circadian clock is its ability to change its internal time (phase) to match that of the external environment. The circadian clock, like many oscillators in nature, is regulated at the cellular level by a complex network of interacting components. As a complementary approach to traditional biological investigation, we utilize mathematical models and systems theoretic tools to elucidate these mechanisms. The models are systems of ordinary differential equations exhibiting stable limit cycle behavior. To study the robustness of circadian phase behavior, we use sensitivity analysis. As the standard set of sensitivity tools are not suitable for the study of phase behavior, we introduce a novel tool, the parametric impulse phase response curve (pIPRC).},

abstract = {The serine/threonine kinase Akt is an upstream positive regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, the mechanism by which Akt activates mTOR is not fully understood. The known pathway by which Akt activates mTOR is via direct phosphorylation and inhibition of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), which is a negative regulator of mTOR. Here we establish an additional pathway by which Akt inhibits TSC2 and activates mTOR. We provide for the first time genetic evidence that Akt regulates intracellular ATP level and demonstrate that Akt is a negative regulator of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is an activator of TSC2. We show that in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells AMP/ATP ratio is markedly elevated with concomitant increase in AMPK activity, whereas in cells expressing activated Akt there is a dramatic decrease in AMP/ATP ratio and a decline in AMPK activity. Currently, the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 and the inhibition of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 are viewed as two separate pathways, which activate mTOR. Our results demonstrate that Akt lies upstream of these two pathways and induces full inhibition of TSC2 and activation of mTOR both through direct phosphorylation and by inhibition of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2. We propose that the activation of mTOR by Akt-mediated cellular energy and inhibition of AMPK is the predominant pathway by which Akt activates mTOR in vivo.},

abstract = {Cellular life emerged ∼3.7 billion years ago. With scant exception, terrestrial organisms have evolved under predictable daily cycles owing to the Earth's rotation. The advantage conferred on organisms that anticipate such environmental cycles has driven the evolution of endogenous circadian rhythms that tune internal physiology to external conditions. The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms. Furthermore, we explore the interconnectivity between these metabolic cycles and transcription-translation feedback loops of the clockwork in each system. Our results suggest an intimate co-evolution of cellular timekeeping with redox homeostatic mechanisms after the Great Oxidation Event ∼2.5 billion years ago.},

abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus governs daily variations of physiology and behavior in mammals. Within single neurons, interlocked transcriptional/translational feedback loops generate circadian rhythms on the molecular level. We present a mathematical model that reflects the essential features of the mammalian circadian oscillator to characterize the differential roles of negative and positive feedback loops. The oscillations that are obtained have a 24-h period and are robust toward parameter variations even when the positive feedback is replaced by a constantly expressed activator. This demonstrates the crucial role of the negative feedback for rhythm generation. Moreover, it explains the rhythmic phenotype of Rev-erbalpha-/- mutant mice, where a positive feedback is missing. The interplay of negative and positive feedback reveals a complex dynamics. In particular, the model explains the unexpected rescue of circadian oscillations in Per2Brdm1/Cry2-/- double-mutant mice (Per2Brdm1 single-mutant mice are arrhythmic). Here, a decrease of positive feedback strength associated with mutating the Per2 gene is compensated by the Cry2-/- mutation that simultaneously decreases the negative feedback strength. Finally, this model leads us to a testable prediction of a molecular and behavioral phenotype: circadian oscillations should be rescued when arrhythmic Per2Brdm1 mutant mice are crossed with Rev- erbalpha -/- mutant mice.},

abstract = {Molecular circadian clock regulation engages a negative feedback loop comprising components of the negative limb, PERs and CRYs. In addition to the rhythmic transcriptional regulation of clock genes, controlled subcellular localization might contribute to the molecular mechanism of the mammalian circadian clock. To address this issue, we generated transgenic (TG) mice lines harboring either rat PER2 (rPER2) with a deleted nuclear localizing domain [NLD(-)] or intact PER2. In comparison with wild-type (WT) control, the period of the circadian locomotor rhythm in TG mice over-expressing NLD(-) PER2 was longer, while that in TG mice over-expressing intact PER2 was shorter. The nuclear entry of endogenous PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 was delayed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of NLD(-) PER2 TG mice under constant darkness, whereas that of mouse PER2 (mPER2) is accelerated in the SCN of intact PER2 TG mice. Under constant light, the locomotor activity of NLD(-) PER2 TG mice became arrhythmic, whereas WT animals remained rhythmic. These data indicate that PER2 controls circadian periods through nuclear localization in the SCN. In addition, sleep architecture was also affected in intact PER2 TG mice, suggesting PER2 can modulate a sleep molecular mechanism.},

Here we show that adipocyte-specific deletion of Arntl (also known as Bmal1), a gene encoding a core molecular clock component, results in obesity in mice with a shift in the diurnal rhythm of food intake, a result that is not seen when the gene is disrupted in hepatocytes or pancreatic islets. Changes in the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate appetite are consistent with feedback from the adipocyte to the central nervous system to time feeding behavior. Ablation of the adipocyte clock is associated with a reduced number of polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipocyte triglycerides. This difference between mutant and wild-type mice is reflected in the circulating concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids and nonesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids in hypothalamic neurons that regulate food intake. Thus, this study reveals a role for the adipocyte clock in the temporal organization of energy regulation, highlights timing as a modulator of the adipocyte-hypothalamic axis and shows the impact of timing of food intake on body weight.},

A critical question for understanding pacemaker function is how SCN oscillators are organized into a coherent tissue capable of coordinating circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology. Here we undertake a comprehensive analysis of oscillatory function across the SCN of the adult PER2::LUC mouse by developing a novel approach involving multi-position bioluminescence imaging and unbiased computational analyses. We demonstrate that there is phase heterogeneity across all three dimensions of the SCN that is intrinsically regulated and extrinsically modulated by light in a region-specific manner. By investigating the mechanistic bases of SCN phase heterogeneity, we show for the first time that phase differences are not systematically related to regional differences in period, waveform, amplitude, or brightness. Furthermore, phase differences are not related to regional differences in the expression of arginine vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, two key neuropeptides characterizing functionally distinct subdivisions of the SCN. The consistency of SCN spatiotemporal organization across individuals and across planes of section suggests that the precise phasing of oscillators is a robust feature of the pacemaker important for its function.},

Classical sensitivity analysis, however, does not directly apply to discrete stochastic dynamical systems, which have recently gained popularity because of its relevance in the simulation of biological processes. In this work, sensitivity analysis for discrete stochastic processes is developed based on density function (distribution) sensitivity, using an analog of the classical sensitivity and the Fisher Information Matrix. There exist many circumstances, such as in systems with multistability, in which the stochastic effects become nontrivial and classical sensitivity analysis on the deterministic representation of a system cannot adequately capture the true system behavior. The proposed analysis is applied to a bistable chemical system--the Schl\"{o}gl model, and to a synthetic genetic toggle-switch model. Comparisons between the stochastic and deterministic analyses show the significance of explicit consideration of the probabilistic nature in the sensitivity analysis for this class of processes.},

abstract = {The genomic and post-genomic eras have been blessing us with overwhelming amounts of data that are of increasing quality. The challenge is that most of these data alone are mere snapshots of the functioning organism and do not reveal the organizational structure of which the particular genes and metabolites are contributors. To gain an appreciation of their roles and functions within cells and organisms, genomic and metabolic data need to be integrated in systems models that allow the testing of hypotheses, generate experimentally testable predictions, and ultimately lead to true explanations. One type of data that is particularly well suited for such integration consists of time profiles, which show gene activities, metabolite concentrations, or protein prevalences at dense series of time points. We show with a specific example how such time series can be analyzed and evaluated, if some structural information about the data is available, even if this information is incomplete. The method consists of three components. The first is a particularly suitable mathematical modeling framework, namely Biochemical Systems Theory, in which parameters are direct indicators of the organization of the underlying phenomenon, the second is the training of an artificial neural network for data smoothing and complementation, and the third is a technique for reinterpreting differential equations in a fashion that facilitates parameter estimation. A prototype webtool for these analyses is available at https://bioinformatics.musc.edu/webmetabol/.},

abstract = {Investigation of the phosphorylation of circadian clock proteins has shown that this modification contributes to circadian timing in all model organisms. Phosphorylation alters the stability, transcriptional activity and subcellular localization of clock proteins during the course of a day, such that time-of-day-specific phosphorylation encodes information for measuring time and is crucial for the establishment of an approximately 24-h period. One main feature of molecular timekeeping is the daytime-specific nuclear accumulation of clock proteins, which can be regulated by phosphorylation. Here, we discuss increasing knowledge of how subcellular shuttling is regulated in circadian clocks, on the basis of recent observations in Neurospora crassa showing that clock proteins undergo maturation through sequential phosphorylation. In this model organism, clock proteins are regulated by the phosphorylation-dependent modulation of rapid shuttling cycles that alter their subcellular localization in a time-of-day-specific manner.},

abstract = {Mammalian metabolism is highly circadian and major hormonal circuits involving nuclear hormone receptors display interlinked diurnal cycling. However, mechanisms that logically explain the coordination of nuclear hormone receptors and the clock are poorly understood. Here we show that two circadian co-regulators, cryptochromes 1 and 2, interact with the glucocorticoid receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote repression. In mice, genetic loss of cryptochrome 1 and/or 2 results in glucose intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, cryptochromes 1 and 2 associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 promoter in a hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers. These results reveal a specific mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal metabolic homeostasis.},

The current paradigm to explain how biological clocks provide timing information is based on multiple interlocking transcription-translation negative feedback loops (TTFL), which drive rhythmic gene expression and circadian behaviour of growth and physiology. Metabolism is an important circadian output, which in plants includes photosynthesis, starch metabolism, nutrient assimilation and redox homeostasis. There is increasing evidence in a range of organisms that these metabolic outputs can also contribute to circadian timing and might also comprise independent circadian oscillators. In this review, we summarise the mechanisms of circadian regulation of metabolism by TTFL and consider increasing evidence that rhythmic metabolism contributes to the circadian network. We highlight how this might be relevant to plant circadian clock function.},

Here, we generated CRY2 (S557A) mutant mice, in which Ser557 phosphorylation is specifically abolished. The mutation lengthened free-running periods of the behavioral rhythms and PER2::LUC bioluminescence rhythms of cultured liver. In the mutant liver, nuclear CRY2 level was elevated with enhanced PER2 nuclear occupancy and suppression of E-box-regulated genes. Thus, Ser557-phosphorylation-dependent regulation of CRY2 is essential for proper clock oscillation in vivo.},

Finally, we review the procedures of linear stability analysis, which allow one to determine whether a given ODE model and a particular set of kinetic parameters will produce oscillations.},

Epidemiological studies from recent decades have supported a unique role for circadian rhythm in metabolism. As evidenced by individuals working night or rotating shifts, but also by rodent models of circadian arrhythmia, disruption of the circadian cycle is strongly associated with metabolic imbalance. Some genetically engineered mouse models of circadian rhythmicity are obese and show hallmark signs of the metabolic syndrome. Whether these phenotypes are due to the loss of distinct circadian clock genes within a specific tissue versus the disruption of rhythmic physiological activities (such as eating and sleeping) remains a cynosure within the fields of chronobiology and metabolism. Becoming more apparent is that from metabolites to transcription factors, the circadian clock interfaces with metabolism in numerous ways that are essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.},

We have interrogated the transcriptional architecture of the circadian transcriptional regulatory loop on a genome scale in mouse liver and find a stereotyped, time-dependent pattern of transcription factor binding, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment, RNA expression, and chromatin states. We find that the circadian transcriptional cycle of the clock consists of three distinct phases: a poised state, a coordinated de novo transcriptional activation state, and a repressed state. Only 22\% of messenger RNA (mRNA) cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription, suggesting that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms underlie the mammalian circadian clock. We also find that circadian modulation of RNAPII recruitment and chromatin remodeling occurs on a genome-wide scale far greater than that seen previously by gene expression profiling.},

abstract = {Inducible gene expression appears to be an essential event that couples light to entrainment of the master mammalian circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Recently, we reported that light triggers phase-dependent activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a major regulator of protein synthesis, in the SCN, thus raising the possibility that mTOR-evoked mRNA translation contributes to clock entrainment. Here, we used a combination of cellular, molecular, and behavioral assays to address this question. To this end, we show that the in vivo infusion of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin led to a significant attenuation of the phase-delaying effect of early-night light. Conversely, disruption of mTOR during the late night augmented the phase-advancing effect of light. To assess the role of mTOR signaling within the context of molecular entrainment, the effects of rapamycin on light-induced expression of PERIOD1 and PERIOD2 were examined. At both the early- and late-night time points, abrogation of mTOR signaling led to a significant attenuation of light-evoked PERIOD protein expression. Our results also reveal that light-induced mTOR activation leads to the translation of mRNAs with a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tract such as eukaryotic elongation factor 1A and the immediate early gene JunB. Together, these data indicate that the mTOR pathway functions as potent and selective regulator of light-evoked protein translation and SCN clock entrainment.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-h oscillations in behavior and physiology, which are internally generated and function to anticipate the environmental changes associated with the solar day. A conserved transcriptional-translational autoregulatory loop generates molecular oscillations of 'clock genes' at the cellular level. In mammals, the circadian system is organized in a hierarchical manner, in which a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates downstream oscillators in peripheral tissues. Recent findings have revealed that the clock is cell-autonomous and self-sustained not only in a central pacemaker, the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and in dissociated cultured cells. It is becoming evident that specific contribution of each clock component and interactions among the components vary in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we review the general mechanisms of the circadian clockwork, describe recent findings that elucidate tissue-specific expression patterns of the clock genes and address the importance of circadian regulation in peripheral tissues for an organism's overall well-being.},

abstract = {The circadian clock governs a large array of physiological functions through the transcriptional control of a significant fraction of the genome. Disruption of the clock leads to metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes. As food is a potent zeitgeber (ZT) for peripheral clocks, metabolites are implicated as cellular transducers of circadian time for tissues such as the liver. From a comprehensive dataset of over 500 metabolites identified by mass spectrometry, we reveal the coordinate clock-controlled oscillation of many metabolites, including those within the amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways as well as the lipid, nucleotide, and xenobiotic metabolic pathways. Using computational modeling, we present evidence of synergistic nodes between the circadian transcriptome and specific metabolic pathways. Validation of these nodes reveals that diverse metabolic pathways, including the uracil salvage pathway, oscillate in a circadian fashion and in a CLOCK-dependent manner. This integrated map illustrates the coherence within the circadian metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome and how these are connected through specific nodes that operate in concert to achieve metabolic homeostasis.},

CK1epsilon(tau/tau) also accelerated molecular oscillations in peripheral tissues, revealing its global role in circadian pacemaking. CK1epsilon(tau) acted by promoting degradation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic PERIOD, but not CRYPTOCHROME, proteins. Together, these whole-animal and biochemical studies explain how tau, as a gain-of-function mutation, acts at a specific circadian phase to promote degradation of PERIOD proteins and thereby accelerate the mammalian clockwork in brain and periphery.},

Introduction of hydrophobic functional groups facilitated rapid conversion of the protein from a random coil to a beta-sheet structure, while addition of hydrophilic groups inhibited this process. hMSCs were grown on these modified silks to assess the biocompatibility of these materials. The hydrophilicity of the silk derivatives was found to affect the growth rate and morphology, but hMSCs were able to attach, proliferate and differentiate into an osteogenic lineage on all of the silk derivatives.},

In rat-1 fibroblasts, up to three consecutive daily oscillations with an average period length of 22.5 hr could be recorded. The temporal sequence of the various mRNA accumulation cycles is the same in cultured cells and in vivo.

Both for large networks (in which statistical analysis is often framed in terms of the abundance of repeated small subgraphs) and for small networks which can be analyzed in greater detail (or even synthesized in vivo and subjected to experiment), revealing the relationship between the topology of small subgraphs and their biological function has been a central goal. We here seek to pose this revelation as a statistical task, illustrated using a particular setup which has been constructed experimentally and for which parameterized models of transcriptional regulation have been studied extensively. The question "how does function follow form" is here mathematized by identifying which topological attributes correlate with the diverse possible information-processing tasks which a transcriptional regulatory network can realize. The resulting method reveals one form-function relationship which had earlier been predicted based on analytic results, and reveals a second for which we can provide an analytic interpretation.

abstract = {The molecular clock maintains energy constancy by producing circadian oscillations of rate-limiting enzymes involved in tissue metabolism across the day and night. During periods of feeding, pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, and although rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes, it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process. Here we show that pancreatic islets possess self-sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. The phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth, glucose metabolism and insulin signalling is delayed in circadian mutant mice, and both Clock and Bmal1 (also called Arntl) mutants show impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age. Clock disruption leads to transcriptome-wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth, survival and synaptic vesicle assembly. Notably, conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective beta-cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus-secretion coupling. These results demonstrate a role for the beta-cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep-wake cycle, and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {The endogenous circadian timing system has evolved to synchronize an organism to periodically recurring environmental conditions. Those external time cues are called Zeitgebers. When entrained by a Zeitgeber, the intrinsic oscillator adopts a fixed phase relation $\psi$ to the Zeitgeber. Here, we systematically study how the phase of entrainment depends on clock and Zeitgeber properties. We combine numerical simulations of amplitude-phase models with predictions from analytically tractable models. In this way we derive relations between the phase of entrainment $\psi$ to the mismatch between the endogenous and Zeitgeber period, the Zeitgeber strength, and the range of entrainment. A core result is the "180° rule" asserting that the phase $\psi$ varies over a range of about 180° within the entrainment range. The 180° rule implies that clocks with a narrow entrainment range ("strong oscillators") exhibit quite flexible entrainment phases. We argue that this high sensitivity of the entrainment phase contributes to the wide range of human chronotypes.},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal oscillations of the Escherichia coli proteins MinD and MinE direct cell division to the region between the chromosomes. Several quantitative models of the Min system have been suggested before, but no one of them accounts for the behavior of all documented mutant phenotypes. We analyzed the stochastic reaction-diffusion kinetics of the Min proteins for several E. coli mutants and compared the results to the corresponding deterministic mean-field description. We found that wild-type (wt) and filamentous (ftsZ-) cells are well characterized by the mean-field model, but that a stochastic model is necessary to account for several of the characteristics of the spherical (rodA-) and phospathedylethanolamide-deficient (PE-) phenotypes. For spherical cells, the mean-field model is bistable, and the system can get trapped in a non-oscillatory state. However, when the intrinsic noise is considered, only the experimentally observed oscillatory behavior remains. The stochastic model also reproduces the change in oscillation directions observed in the spherical phenotype and the occasional gliding of the MinD region along the inner membrane. For the PE- mutant, the stochastic model explains the appearance of randomly localized and dense MinD clusters as a nucleation phenomenon, in which the stochastic kinetics at low copy number causes local discharges of the high MinD(ATP) to MinD(ADP) potential. We find that a simple five-reaction model of the Min system can explain all documented Min phenotypes, if stochastic kinetics and three-dimensional diffusion are accounted for. Our results emphasize that local copy number fluctuation may result in phenotypic differences although the total number of molecules of the relevant species is high.},

The basic steps for building an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based mechanistic model (i.e., structure characterization, model simulation, parameter estimation, and sensitivity analysis) are reviewed paying special attention to the case of oscillating systems. Moreover, novel statistical models for inferring differentially expressed genes, signaling pathways, functional clusters, and genetic networks are presented. Statistical tools, such as COMBINER (Core Module Biomarker Identification with Network Exploration), provide a comprehensive interaction map within and between pathways that can be translated to ODE models. Combining statistical and ODE modelling techniques can greatly enhance predictive capacity. The power of these approaches to identify biomarkers and drug target mechanisms is illustrated with application to the core mammalian feedback circuit and posttraumatic stress disorder.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythm disturbances are observed in, e.g., aging and neurodegenerative diseases and are associated with an increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. We subjected male C57Bl/6J mice to constant light [12-h light-light (LL) cycle] to examine the effects of a disturbed circadian rhythm on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the central pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) revealed an immediate reduction in rhythm amplitude, stabilizing at 44\% of normal amplitude values after 4 d LL. Food intake was increased (+26\%) and energy expenditure decreased (-13\%), and we observed immediate body weight gain (d 4: +2.4\%, d 14: +5.0\%). Mixed model analysis revealed that weight gain developed more rapidly in response to LL as compared to high fat. After 4 wk in LL, the circadian pattern in feeding and energy expenditure was completely lost, despite continuing low-amplitude rhythms in the SCN and in behavior, whereas weight gain had stabilized. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis revealed complete abolishment of normal circadian variation in insulin sensitivity in LL. In conclusion, a reduction in amplitude of the SCN, to values previously observed in aged mice, is sufficient to induce a complete loss of circadian rhythms in energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity.-Coomans, C.

abstract = {A direct sensitivity analysis technique is extended to calculate higher-order sensitivity coefficients in three-dimensional air quality models. The time evolution of sensitivity coefficients of different order is followed alongside that of the concentrations. Calculation of higher-order sensitivity coefficients requires few modifications to the original (first-order) sensitivity modules and is carried out efficiently and with minimal computational overhead. The modeling results (first-, second-, and third-order sensitivity coefficients) for an ozone episode in central California are shown and discussed. Second-order sensitivity coefficients of ozone concentration with respect to domain-wide NO emissions show reasonable agreement with brute-force results and exhibit less noisy behavior. By using second-order sensitivity coefficients the nonlinear responses are better captured and described. For a Taylor series projection from the base case, including the second-order term improves the accuracy. In general, higher-order sensitivity analysis shows a noticeable improvement in terms of accuracy over the conventional first-order analysis. Of particular interest, second-order sensitivity analysis is better equipped to address the nonlinear behavior around the peak ozone in NO(x)-rich plumes.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. The main cause of this cancer is DNA damage induced by the UV component of sunlight. In humans and mice, UV damage is removed by the nucleotide excision repair system. Here, we report that a rate-limiting subunit of excision repair, the xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) protein, and the excision repair rate exhibit daily rhythmicity in mouse skin, with a minimum in the morning and a maximum in the afternoon/evening. In parallel with the rhythmicity of repair rate, we find that mice exposed to UV radiation (UVR) at 4:00 AM display a decreased latency and about a fivefold increased multiplicity of skin cancer (invasive squamous cell carcinoma) than mice exposed to UVR at 4:00 PM. We conclude that time of day of exposure to UVR is a contributing factor to its carcinogenicity in mice, and possibly in humans.},

@article{Tsai2008,
abstract = {A simple negative feedback loop of interacting genes or proteins has the potential to generate sustained oscillations. However, many biological oscillators also have a positive feedback loop, raising the question of what advantages the extra loop imparts. Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

@article{Leloup2004,
abstract = {We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 mRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY and the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark (LD) cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per mRNA from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome.},

Knowledge about these networks is mainly of qualitative nature, which allows the construction of Boolean models, where the state of a component is either 'off' or 'on'.

Reactivation of CLOCK-BMAL1 occurs at a specific time several hours after PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME protein turnover, but the mechanism underlying this process is unknown. We found that mouse BMAL1 complexes include TRAP150 (thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein-150; also known as THRAP3). TRAP150 is a selective coactivator for CLOCK-BMAL1, which oscillates under CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional control. TRAP150 promotes CLOCK-BMAL1 binding to target genes and links CLOCK-BMAL1 to the transcriptional machinery at target-gene promoters. Depletion of TRAP150 caused low-amplitude, long-period rhythms, identifying it as a positive clock element. The activity of TRAP150 defines a positive feedback loop within the clock and provides a potential mechanism for timing the reactivation of circadian transcription.},

abstract = {Circadian (ca. 24 hr) oscillations in expression of mammalian "clock genes" are found not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, but also in peripheral tissues. Under constant conditions in vitro, however, rhythms of peripheral tissue explants or immortalized cells damp partially or completely. It is unknown whether this reflects an inability of peripheral cells to sustain rhythms, as SCN neurons can, or a loss of synchrony among cells. Using bioluminescence imaging of Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with a Bmal1::luc plasmid and primary fibroblasts dissociated from mPer2(Luciferase-SV40) knockin mice, we monitored single-cell circadian rhythms of clock gene expression for 1-2 weeks. We found that single fibroblasts can oscillate robustly and independently with undiminished amplitude and diverse circadian periods. Cells were partially synchronized by medium changes at the start of an experiment, but due to different intrinsic periods, their phases became randomly distributed after several days. Closely spaced cells in the same culture did not have similar phases, implying a lack of functional coupling among cells. Thus, like SCN neurons, single fibroblasts can function as independent circadian oscillators; however, lack of oscillator coupling in dissociated cell cultures leads to a loss of synchrony among individual cells and damping of the ensemble rhythm at the population level.},

We worked with the hypothesis that observed 12 hr rhythms in gene expression are the results of an interplay between components of the circadian clock. Analysis of mouse liver expression data indeed revealed a strong circadian component in observed 12 hr gene expression rhythms. We show theoretically that pairs of circadian transcription factors with certain circadian phase relationships can give rise to these 12 hr rhythms, if binding noncompetitively to the promoters of regulated genes. We took an inventory of circadian transcription factors in mouse liver using available microarray data and matched these to predicted binding sites in the promoters of genes displaying 12 hr rhythms. Binding sites for transcription factor pairs with phase relationships predicted by theory were overrepresented in these promoters.},

@article{Fulco2008,
abstract = {It is intuitive to speculate that nutrient availability may influence differentiation of mammalian cells. Nonetheless, a comprehensive complement of the molecular determinants involved in this process has not been elucidated yet. Here, we have investigated how nutrients (glucose) affect skeletal myogenesis. Glucose restriction (GR) impaired differentiation of skeletal myoblasts and was associated with activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activated AMPK was required to promote GR-induced transcription of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme Nampt. Indeed, GR augmented the Nampt activity, which consequently modified the intracellular [NAD+]:[NADH] ratio and nicotinamide levels, and mediated inhibition of skeletal myogenesis. Skeletal myoblasts derived from SIRT1+/- heterozygous mice were resistant to the effects of either GR or AMPK activation. These experiments reveal that AMPK, Nampt, and SIRT1 are the molecular components of a functional signaling pathway that allows skeletal muscle cells to sense and react to nutrient availability.},

abstract = {Circadian timing is generated through a unique series of autoregulatory interactions termed the molecular clock. Behavioral rhythms subject to the molecular clock are well characterized. We demonstrate a role for Bmal1 and Clock in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Inactivation of the known clock components Bmal1 (Mop3) and Clock suppress the diurnal variation in glucose and triglycerides. Gluconeogenesis is abolished by deletion of Bmal1 and is depressed in Clock mutants, but the counterregulatory response of corticosterone and glucagon to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia is retained. Furthermore, a high-fat diet modulates carbohydrate metabolism by amplifying circadian variation in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and mutation of Clock restores the chow-fed phenotype. Bmal1 and Clock, genes that function in the core molecular clock, exert profound control over recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, asynchronous dietary cues may modify glucose homeostasis via their interactions with peripheral molecular clocks.},

@article{Singhania2011c,
abstract = {The timing of DNA synthesis, mitosis and cell division is regulated by a complex network of biochemical reactions that control the activities of a family of cyclin-dependent kinases. The temporal dynamics of this reaction network is typically modeled by nonlinear differential equations describing the rates of the component reactions. This approach provides exquisite details about molecular regulatory processes but is hampered by the need to estimate realistic values for the many kinetic constants that determine the reaction rates. It is difficult to estimate these kinetic constants from available experimental data. To avoid this problem, modelers often resort to 'qualitative' modeling strategies, such as Boolean switching networks, but these models describe only the coarsest features of cell cycle regulation. In this paper we describe a hybrid approach that combines the best features of continuous differential equations and discrete Boolean networks. Cyclin abundances are tracked by piecewise linear differential equations for cyclin synthesis and degradation. Cyclin synthesis is regulated by transcription factors whose activities are represented by discrete variables (0 or 1) and likewise for the activities of the ubiquitin-ligating enzyme complexes that govern cyclin degradation. The discrete variables change according to a predetermined sequence, with the times between transitions determined in part by cyclin accumulation and degradation and as well by exponentially distributed random variables. The model is evaluated in terms of flow cytometry measurements of cyclin proteins in asynchronous populations of human cell lines. The few kinetic constants in the model are easily estimated from the experimental data. Using this hybrid approach, modelers can quickly create quantitatively accurate, computational models of protein regulatory networks in cells.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {During fasting, mammals maintain normal glucose homeostasis by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. Elevations in circulating glucagon and epinephrine, two hormones that activate hepatic gluconeogenesis, trigger the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) and dephosphorylation of the Creb-regulated transcription coactivator-2 (Crtc2)--two key transcriptional regulators of this process. Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, hepatic gluconeogenesis is also regulated by the circadian clock, which coordinates glucose metabolism with changes in the external environment. Circadian control of gene expression is achieved by two transcriptional activators, Clock and Bmal1, which stimulate cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) repressors that feed back on Clock-Bmal1 activity. Here we show that Creb activity during fasting is modulated by Cry1 and Cry2, which are rhythmically expressed in the liver. Cry1 expression was elevated during the night-day transition, when it reduced fasting gluconeogenic gene expression by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and in the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Creb. In biochemical reconstitution studies, we found that Cry1 inhibited accumulation of cAMP in response to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation but not to forskolin, a direct activator of adenyl cyclase. Cry proteins seemed to modulate GPCR activity directly through interaction with G(s)$\alpha$. As hepatic overexpression of Cry1 lowered blood glucose concentrations and improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant db/db mice, our results suggest that compounds that enhance cryptochrome activity may provide therapeutic benefit to individuals with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {We propose a convex optimization procedure for black-box identification of nonlinear state-space models for systems that exhibit stable limit cycles (unforced periodic solutions). It extends the "robust identification error" framework in which a convex upper bound on simulation error is optimized to fit rational polynomial models with a strong stability guarantee. In this work, we relax the stability constraint using the concepts of transverse dynamics and orbital stability, thus allowing systems with autonomous oscillations to be identified. The resulting optimization problem is convex, and can be formulated as a semidefinite program. A simulation-error bound is proved without assuming that the true system is in the model class, or that the number of measurements goes to infinity. Conditions which guarantee existence of a unique limit cycle of the model are proved and related to the model class that we search over. The method is illustrated by identifying a high-fidelity model from experimental recordings of a live rat hippocampal neuron in culture.},

Z. 49, 333-369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information . Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather V(max)/K(m), the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (k(cat)/K(m) × E(0)).},

In turn, loss-of-function experiments indicated that CIRP was required for high-amplitude circadian gene expression. The transcriptome-wide identification of CIRP-bound RNAs by a biotin-streptavidin-based cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) procedure revealed several transcripts encoding circadian oscillator proteins, including CLOCK. Moreover, CLOCK accumulation was strongly reduced in CIRP-depleted fibroblasts. Because ectopic expression of CLOCK improved circadian gene expression in these cells, we surmise that CIRP confers robustness to circadian oscillators through regulation of CLOCK expression.},

Our method is simple and general because it is designed only to reconstruct the pattern of protein synthesis, without assuming any specific regulatory mechanisms. It can be applied to a wide range of cell types, patterns of expression, and reporter systems, and is implemented in publicly available spreadsheets. We show that our method is robust to a several possible types of error, and argue that uncertainty about the decay kinetics of reporter proteins is the limiting factor in reconstructing the temporal pattern of gene expression dynamics from reporter protein assays. With improved estimates of reporter protein decay rates, our approach could allow for detailed reconstruction of gene expression dynamics from commonly used reporter protein systems.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sensitivity analysis provides key measures that aid in unraveling the design principles responsible for the robust performance of biological networks. Such metrics allow researchers to investigate comprehensively model performance, to develop more realistic models, and to design informative experiments. However, sensitivity analysis of oscillatory systems focuses on period and amplitude characteristics, while biologically relevant effects on phase are neglected. RESULTS: Here, we introduce a novel set of phase-based sensitivity metrics for performance: period, phase, corrected phase and relative phase. Both state- and phase-based tools are applied to free-running Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus circadian models. Each metric produces unique sensitivity values used to rank parameters from least to most sensitive. Similarities among the resulting rank distributions strongly suggest a conservation of sensitivity with respect to parameter function and type. A consistent result, for instance, is that model performance of biological oscillators is more sensitive to global parameters than local (i.e. circadian specific) parameters. Discrepancies among these distributions highlight the individual metrics' definition of performance as specific parametric sensitivity values depend on the defined metric, or output. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the algorithm in MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.) is available from the authors. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Brain aging is associated with diminished circadian clock output and decreased expression of the core clock proteins, which regulate many aspects of cellular biochemistry and metabolism. The genes encoding clock proteins are expressed throughout the brain, though it is unknown whether these proteins modulate brain homeostasis. We observed that deletion of circadian clock transcriptional activators aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Bmal1) alone, or circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) in combination with neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (Npas2), induced severe age-dependent astrogliosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Mice lacking the clock gene repressors period circadian clock 1 (Per1) and period circadian clock 2 (Per2) had no observed astrogliosis. Bmal1 deletion caused the degeneration of synaptic terminals and impaired cortical functional connectivity, as well as neuronal oxidative damage and impaired expression of several redox defense genes. Targeted deletion of Bmal1 in neurons and glia caused similar neuropathology, despite the retention of intact circadian behavioral and sleep-wake rhythms. Reduction of Bmal1 expression promoted neuronal death in primary cultures and in mice treated with a chemical inducer of oxidative injury and striatal neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate that BMAL1 in a complex with CLOCK or NPAS2 regulates cerebral redox homeostasis and connects impaired clock gene function to neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Increased longevity and improved health can be achieved in mammals by two feeding regimens, caloric restriction (CR), which limits the amount of daily calorie intake, and intermittent fasting (IF), which allows the food to be available ad libitum every other day. The precise mechanisms mediating these beneficial effects are still unresolved. Resetting the circadian clock is another intervention that can lead to increased life span and well being, while clock disruption is associated with aging and morbidity. Currently, a large body of evidence links circadian rhythms with metabolism and feeding regimens. In particular, CR, and possibly also IF, can entrain the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the brain hypothalamus. These findings raise the hypothesis that the beneficial effects exerted by these feeding regimens could be mediated, at least in part, through resetting of the circadian clock, thus leading to synchrony in metabolism and physiology. This hypothesis is reinforced by a transgenic mouse model showing spontaneously reduced eating alongside robust circadian rhythms and increased life span. This review will summarize recent findings concerning the relationships between feeding regimens, circadian rhythms, and metabolism with implications for ageing attenuation and life span extension.},

abstract = {Light is a prominent stimulus that synchronizes endogenous circadian rhythmicity to environmental light/dark cycles. Nocturnal light elevates mRNA of the Period1 (Per1) gene and induces long term state changes, expressed as phase shifts of circadian rhythms. The cellular mechanism for Per1 elevation and light-induced phase advance in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a process initiated primarily by glutamatergic neurotransmission from the retinohypothalamic tract, was examined. Glutamate (GLU)-induced phase advances in the rat SCN were blocked by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) against Per1 and Ca(2+)/cAMP response element (CRE)-decoy ODN. CRE-decoy ODN also blocked light-induced phase advances in vivo. Furthermore, the CRE-decoy blocked GLU-induced accumulation of Per1 mRNA. Thus, Ca(2+)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and Per1 are integral components of the pathway transducing light-stimulated GLU neurotransmission into phase advance of the circadian clock.},

abstract = {Circadian timekeeping by intracellular molecular clocks is evident widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The clockworks are driven by autoregulatory feedback loops that lead to oscillating levels of components whose maxima are in fixed phase relationships with one another. These phase relationships are the key metric characterizing the operation of the clocks. In this study, we built a mathematical model from the regulatory structure of the intracellular circadian clock in mice and identified its parameters using an iterative evolutionary strategy, with minimum cost achieved through conformance to phase separations seen in cell-autonomous oscillators. The model was evaluated against the experimentally observed cell-autonomous circadian phenotypes of gene knockouts, particularly retention of rhythmicity and changes in expression level of molecular clock components. These tests reveal excellent de novo predictive ability of the model. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis shows that these knockout phenotypes are robust to parameter perturbation.},

@article{Spiess2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is long known within the mathematical literature that the coefficient of determination R(2) is an inadequate measure for the goodness of fit in nonlinear models. Nevertheless, it is still frequently used within pharmacological and biochemical literature for the analysis and interpretation of nonlinear fitting to data.

RESULTS: The intensive simulation approach undermines previous observations and emphasizes the extremely low performance of R(2) as a basis for model validity and performance when applied to pharmacological/biochemical nonlinear data. In fact, with the 'true' model having up to 500 times more strength of evidence based on Akaike weights, this was only reflected in the third to fifth decimal place of R(2). In addition, even the bias-corrected R(2)(adj) exhibited an extreme bias to higher parametrized models. The bias-corrected AICc and also BIC performed significantly better in this respect.

CONCLUSION: Researchers and reviewers should be aware that R(2) is inappropriate when used for demonstrating the performance or validity of a certain nonlinear model. It should ideally be removed from scientific literature dealing with nonlinear model fitting or at least be supplemented with other methods such as AIC or BIC or used in context to other models in question.},

@article{Ye2011,
abstract = {The current consensus model for the circadian clock in mammals is based on a transcription-translation feedback loop. In this model, CRY and PER proteins repress their own transcription by suppressing the transactivator function of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer directly (physical model) and by facilitating post-translational modifications (chemical model). Most of the data for this model come from genetic and cell biological experiments. Here, we have purified all of the core clock proteins and performed in vitro and in vivo biochemical experiments to test the physical model. We find that CLOCK:BMAL1 binds to an E-box sequence in DNA and that CRY binds stably to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex independently of PER. Both CRY and PER bind to CLOCK and BMAL1 off DNA but, in contrast to CRY, PER does not bind to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. Unexpectedly, PER actually interferes with the binding of CRY to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex. CRY likely destabilizes the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer on DNA by a post-translational mechanism after binding to the complex. These findings support some aspects of the canonical model, but also suggest that some key features of the model need to be revised.},

For these experiments, we monitored the firing rate rhythm of individual clock cells on fixed multielectrode plates in culture and tested the effects of GABA. The results show that the daily variation in responsiveness of the SCN to phase-shifting agents is manifested at the level of individual neurons. Moreover, GABA, acting through A-type receptors, can both phase shift and synchronize clock cells. We propose that GABA is an important synchronizer of SCN neurons in vivo.},

abstract = {The mechanisms and consequences of synchrony among heterogeneous oscillators are poorly understood in biological systems. We present a multicellular, molecular model of the mammalian circadian clock that incorporates recent data implicating the neurotransmitter vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as the key synchronizing agent. The model postulates that synchrony arises among circadian neurons because they release VIP rhythmically on a daily basis and in response to ambient light. Two basic cell types, intrinsically rhythmic pacemakers and damped oscillators, are assumed to arise from a distribution of Period gene transcription rates. Postsynaptic neurons show time-of-day dependent responses to VIP binding through a signaling cascade that activates Period mRNA transcription. The heterogeneous cell ensemble model self-synchronizes, entrains to ambient light-dark cycles, and desynchronizes in constant bright light or upon removal of VIP signaling. The degree of synchronicity observed depends on cell-specific features (e.g., mean and variability of parameters within the rhythm-generating loop), in addition to the more commonly studied effect of intercellular coupling strength. These simulations closely replicate experimental data and predict that heterogeneous oscillations (e.g., sustained, damped, and arrhythmic) arise from small differences in the molecular parameters between cells, that damped oscillators participate in entrainment and synchrony of the ensemble of cells, and that constant light desynchronizes oscillators by maximizing VIP release.},

Such specificity is critical for understanding disease and designing drugs. Here we describe a computational approach--implemented in the free CNO software--for turning signalling networks into logical models and calibrating the models against experimental data. When a literature-derived network of 82 proteins covering the immediate-early responses of human cells to seven cytokines was modelled, we found that training against experimental data dramatically increased predictive power, despite the crudeness of Boolean approximations, while significantly reducing the number of interactions. Thus, many interactions in literature-derived networks do not appear to be functional in the liver cells from which we collected our data. At the same time, CNO identified several new interactions that improved the match of model to data. Although missing from the starting network, these interactions have literature support. Our approach, therefore, represents a means to generate predictive, cell-type-specific models of mammalian signalling from generic protein signalling networks.},

We have shown that the core circadian regulator, CLOCK, is a histone acetyltransferase whose activity is counterbalanced by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1. Here we show that intracellular NAD+ levels cycle with a 24-hour rhythm, an oscillation driven by the circadian clock. CLOCK:BMAL1 regulates the circadian expression of NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), an enzyme that provides a rate-limiting step in the NAD+ salvage pathway. SIRT1 is recruited to the Nampt promoter and contributes to the circadian synthesis of its own coenzyme. Using the specific inhibitor FK866, we demonstrated that NAMPT is required to modulate circadian gene expression. Our findings in mouse embryo fibroblasts reveal an interlocked transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop that governs the molecular interplay between cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC-1alpha) has been extensively described as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, PGC-1alpha activity is not constant and can be finely tuned in response to different metabolic situations. From this point of view, PGC-1alpha could be described as a mediator of the transcriptional outputs triggered by metabolic sensors, providing the idea that these sensors, together with PGC-1alpha, might be weaving a network controlling cellular energy expenditure. In this review, we will focus on how disorders such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome might be related to an abnormal and improper function of this network.

RECENT FINDINGS: Two metabolic sensors, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SIRT1 have been described to directly affect PGC-1alpha activity through phosphorylation and deacetylation, respectively. Although the physiological relevance of these modifications and their molecular consequences are still largely unknown, recent insight from different in-vivo transgenic models clearly suggests that AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha might act as an orchestrated network to improve metabolic fitness.

SUMMARY: Metabolic sensors such as AMPK and SIRT1, gatekeepers of the activity of the master regulator of mitochondria, PGC-1alpha, are vital links in a regulatory network for metabolic homeostasis. Together, these players explain many of the beneficial effects of physical activity and dietary interventions in our battle against type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders. Hence, understanding the mechanisms by which they act could guide us to identify and improve preventive and therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic fuel gauge conserved along the evolutionary scale in eukaryotes that senses changes in the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio. Recent evidence indicated an important role for AMPK in the therapeutic benefits of metformin, thiazolidinediones and exercise, which form the cornerstones of the clinical management of type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic disorders. In general, activation of AMPK acts to maintain cellular energy stores, switching on catabolic pathways that produce ATP, mostly by enhancing oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, while switching off anabolic pathways that consume ATP. This regulation can take place acutely, through the regulation of fast post-translational events, but also by transcriptionally reprogramming the cell to meet energetic needs. Here we demonstrate that AMPK controls the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle by acting in coordination with another metabolic sensor, the NAD+-dependent type III deacetylase SIRT1. AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing cellular NAD+ levels, resulting in the deacetylation and modulation of the activity of downstream SIRT1 targets that include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha and the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and O3 (FOXO3a) transcription factors. The AMPK-induced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of these targets explains many of the convergent biological effects of AMPK and SIRT1 on energy metabolism.},

abstract = {Artificial genetic circuits are becoming important tools for controlling cellular behavior and studying molecular biosystems. To genetically optimize the properties of complex circuits in a practically feasible fashion, it is necessary to identify the best genes and/or their regulatory components as mutation targets to avoid the mutation experiments being wasted on ineffective regions, but this goal is generally not achievable by current methods. The Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR) algorithm is employed in this work as a global sensitivity analysis technique to estimate the sensitivities of the circuit properties with respect to the circuit model parameters, such as rate constants, without knowing the precise parameter values. The sensitivity information can then guide the selection of the optimal mutation targets and thereby reduce the laboratory effort. As a proof of principle, the in vivo effects of 16 pairwise mutations on the properties of a genetic inverter were compared against the RS-HDMR predictions, and the algorithm not only showed good consistency with laboratory results but also revealed useful information, such as different optimal mutation targets for optimizing different circuit properties, not available from previous experiments and modeling.},

abstract = {In the mouse liver, circadian transcriptional rhythms are necessary for metabolic homeostasis. Whether dynamic epigenomic modifications are associated with transcript oscillations has not been systematically investigated. We found that several antisense RNA, lincRNA, and microRNA transcripts also showed circadian oscillations in adult mouse livers. Robust transcript oscillations often correlated with rhythmic histone modifications in promoters, gene bodies, or enhancers, although promoter DNA methylation levels were relatively stable. Such integrative analyses identified oscillating expression of an antisense transcript (asPer2) to the gene encoding the circadian oscillator component Per2. Robust transcript oscillations often accompanied rhythms in multiple histone modifications and recruitment of multiple chromatin-associated clock components. Coupling of cycling histone modifications with nearby oscillating transcripts thus established a temporal relationship between enhancers, genes, and transcripts on a genome-wide scale in a mammalian liver. The results offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of metabolism, circadian clock, and chromatin modifications involved in metabolic homeostasis.},

abstract = {Biochemical reaction networks often exhibit spontaneous self-sustained oscillations. An example is the circadian oscillator that lies at the heart of daily rhythms in behavior and physiology in most organisms including humans. While the period of these oscillators evolved so that it resonates with the 24 h daily environmental cycles, the precision of the oscillator (quantified via the Q factor) is another relevant property of these cell-autonomous oscillators. Since this quantity can be measured in individual cells, it is of interest to better understand how this property behaves across mathematical models of these oscillators. Current theoretical schemes for computing the Q factors show limitations for both high-dimensional models and in the vicinity of Hopf bifurcations. Here, we derive low-noise approximations that lead to numerically stable schemes also in high-dimensional models. In addition, we generalize normal form reductions that are appropriate near Hopf bifurcations. Applying our approximations to two models of circadian clocks, we show that while the low-noise regime is faithfully recapitulated, increasing the level of noise leads to species-dependent precision. We emphasize that subcomponents of the oscillator gradually decouple from the core oscillator as noise increases, which allows us to identify the subnetworks responsible for robust rhythms.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the dynamics of gene expression. Interest often focuses on the topological structure of a GRN while numerical parameters (e.g. decay rates) are unknown and less important. For larger GRNs, inference of structure from gene expression data is prohibitively difficult. Models are often proposed based on integrative interpretation of multiple sources of information. We have developed DoGeNetS (Discrimination of Gene Network Structures), a method to directly assess candidate models of GRN structure against a target gene expression data set. The transsys language serves to model GRN structures. Numeric parameters are optimised to approximate the target data. Multiple restarts of optimisation yield score sets that provide a basis to statistically discriminate candidate models according to their potential to explain the target data. We demonstrate discrimination power of the DoGeNetS method by relating structural divergence to divergence between gene expression data sets. Known models are used to generate target expression data, and a set of candidate models with a defined structural divergence to the true model is produced. Structural divergence and divergence of expression profiles after optimisation are strongly correlated. We further show that discrimination is possible at noise levels exceeding those typical of contemporary microarray data. DoGeNetS is capable of discriminating the best GRN structure from among a small number of candidates. p values indicate whether differences in divergence of expression are significant. Although this study uses single gene knockouts, the DoGeNetS method can be adapted to simulate a virtually unlimited range of experimental conditions. [Includes supplementary material].},

We discovered that Per1 and Cry1 are required for sustained rhythms in peripheral tissues and cells, and in neurons dissociated from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Per2 is also required for sustained rhythms, whereas Cry2 and Per3 deficiencies cause only period length defects. However, oscillator network interactions in the SCN can compensate for Per1 or Cry1 deficiency, preserving sustained rhythmicity in mutant SCN slices and behavior. Thus, behavior does not necessarily reflect cell-autonomous clock phenotypes. Our studies reveal previously unappreciated requirements for Per1, Per2, and Cry1 in sustaining cellular circadian rhythmicity and demonstrate that SCN intercellular coupling is essential not only to synchronize component cellular oscillators but also for robustness against genetic perturbations.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are fundamental to life. In mammals, these rhythms are generated by pacemaker neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is remarkably consistent in structure and function between species, yet mammalian rest/activity patterns are extremely diverse, including diurnal, nocturnal, and crepuscular behaviors. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for this diversity: (i) modulation of SCN output by downstream nuclei, and (ii) direct effects of light on activity. These two mechanisms are difficult to disentangle experimentally and their respective roles remain unknown. To address this, we developed a computational model to simulate the two mechanisms and their influence on temporal niche. In our model, SCN output is relayed via the subparaventricular zone (SPZ) to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and thence to ventrolateral preoptic nuclei (VLPO) and lateral hypothalamus (LHA). Using this model, we generated rich phenotypes that closely resemble experimental data. Modulation of SCN output at the SPZ was found to generate a full spectrum of diurnal-to-nocturnal phenotypes. Intriguingly, we also uncovered a novel mechanism for crepuscular behavior: if DMH/VLPO and DMH/LHA projections act cooperatively, daily activity is unimodal, but if they act competitively, activity can become bimodal. In addition, we successfully reproduced diurnal/nocturnal switching in the rodent Octodon degu using coordinated inversions in both masking and circadian modulation. Finally, the model correctly predicted the SCN lesion phenotype in squirrel monkeys: loss of circadian rhythmicity and emergence of ∼4-h sleep/wake cycles. In capturing these diverse phenotypes, the model provides a powerful new framework for understanding rest/activity patterns and relating them to underlying physiology. Given the ubiquitous effects of temporal organization on all aspects of animal behavior and physiology, this study sheds light on the physiological changes required to orchestrate adaptation to various temporal niches.},

abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian pacemaker of mammals, coordinating daily rhythms of behavior and metabolism. Circadian timekeeping in SCN neurons revolves around transcriptional/posttranslational feedback loops, in which Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes are negatively regulated by their protein products. Recent studies have revealed, however, that these "core loops" also rely upon cytosolic and circuit-level properties for sustained oscillation. To characterize interneuronal signals responsible for robust pacemaking in SCN cells and circuits, we have developed a unique coculture technique using wild-type (WT) "graft" SCN to drive pacemaking (reported by PER2::LUCIFERASE bioluminescence) in "host" SCN deficient either in elements of neuropeptidergic signaling or in elements of the core feedback loop. We demonstrate that paracrine signaling is sufficient to restore cellular synchrony and amplitude of pacemaking in SCN circuits lacking vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). By using grafts with mutant circadian periods we show that pacemaking in the host SCN is specified by the genotype of the graft, confirming graft-derived factors as determinants of the host rhythm. By combining pharmacological with genetic manipulations, we show that a hierarchy of neuropeptidergic signals underpins this paracrine regulation, with a preeminent role for VIP augmented by contributions from arginine vasopressin (AVP) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Finally, we show that interneuronal signaling is sufficiently powerful to maintain circadian pacemaking in arrhythmic Cry-null SCN, deficient in essential elements of the transcriptional negative feedback loops. Thus, a hierarchy of paracrine neuropeptidergic signals determines cell- and circuit-level circadian pacemaking in the SCN.},

Circadian clocks present a particularly interesting instance, as recent work has shown that they have complex structures involving multiple interconnected feedback loops with both positive and negative feedback. While several authors have speculated on the reasons for this, a convincing explanation is still lacking. We analyse both the flexibility of clock networks and the relationships between various desirable properties such as robust entrainment, temperature compensation, and stability to environmental variations and parameter fluctuations. We use this to argue that the complexity provides the flexibility necessary to simultaneously attain multiple key properties of circadian clocks. As part of our analysis we show how to quantify the key evolutionary aims using infinitesimal response curves, a tool that we believe will be of general utility in the analysis of regulatory networks. Our results suggest that regulatory and signalling networks might be much less flexible and of lower dimension than their apparent complexity would suggest.},

@article{Ananthasubramaniam2014a,
abstract = {A simple three-component negative feedback loop is a recurring motif in biochemical oscillators. This motif oscillates as it has the three necessary ingredients for oscillations: a three-step delay, negative feedback, and nonlinearity in the loop. However, to oscillate, this motif under the common Goodwin formulation requires a high degree of cooperativity (a measure of nonlinearity) in the feedback that is biologically "unlikely." Moreover, this recurring negative feedback motif is commonly observed augmented by positive feedback interactions. Here we show that these positive feedback interactions promote oscillation at lower degrees of cooperativity, and we can thus unify several common kinetic mechanisms that facilitate oscillations, such as self-activation and Michaelis-Menten degradation. The positive feedback loops are most beneficial when acting on the shortest lived component, where they function by balancing the lifetimes of the different components. The benefits of multiple positive feedback interactions are cumulative for a majority of situations considered, when benefits are measured by the reduction in the cooperativity required to oscillate. These positive feedback motifs also allow oscillations with longer periods than that determined by the lifetimes of the components alone. We can therefore conjecture that these positive feedback loops have evolved to facilitate oscillations at lower, kinetically achievable, degrees of cooperativity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our conclusions on the mammalian molecular clock, a system modeled extensively based on the three-component negative feedback loop.},

abstract = {The number of mRNA and protein molecules expressed from a single gene molecule fluctuates over time. These fluctuations have been attributed, in part, to the random transitioning of promoters between transcriptionally active and inactive states, causing transcription to occur in bursts. However, the molecular basis of transcriptional bursting remains poorly understood. By electron microscopy of single PHO5 gene molecules from yeast, we show that the "activated" promoter assumes alternative nucleosome configurations at steady state, including the maximally repressive, fully nucleosomal, and the maximally non-repressive, nucleosome-free, configuration. We demonstrate that the observed probabilities of promoter nucleosome configurations are obtained from a simple, intrinsically stochastic process of nucleosome assembly, disassembly, and position-specific sliding; and we show that gene expression and promoter nucleosome configuration can be mechanistically coupled, relating promoter nucleosome dynamics and gene expression fluctuations. Together, our findings suggest a structural basis for transcriptional bursting, and offer new insights into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and the kinetics of promoter nucleosome transitions.},

In the latter protocol, the contribution of a sleep/wake dependent process and a circadian process to alertness and performance were separated by folding the data at either the period of the sleep/wake cycle or at the period of the endogenous circadian body temperature rhythm. This analysis revealed that prior wakefulness within a range of 0-18 h significantly reduced alertness and performance and that the circadian rhythm of core body temperature paralleled the circadian rhythm of alertness and performance. During the first 16 h of the constant routine protocol, which coincided with the subjects' habitual period of wakefulness, alertness and performance remained at a stable level. The latter finding was explained by assuming that during our usual waking day the circadian system counteracts the detrimental effects of increasing duration of prior wakefulness.},

abstract = {In mammals, the circadian oscillator generates approximately 24-h rhythms in feeding behavior, even under constant environmental conditions. Livers of mice held under constant darkness exhibit circadian rhythm in abundance in up to 15\% of expressed transcripts. Therefore, oscillations in hepatic transcripts could be driven by rhythmic food intake or sustained by the hepatic circadian oscillator, or a combination of both. To address this question, we used distinct feeding and fasting paradigms on wild-type (WT) and circadian clock-deficient mice. We monitored temporal patterns of feeding and hepatic transcription. Both food availability and the temporal pattern of feeding determined the repertoire, phase, and amplitude of the circadian transcriptome in WT liver. In the absence of feeding, only a small subset of transcripts continued to express circadian patterns. Conversely, temporally restricted feeding restored rhythmic transcription of hundreds of genes in oscillator-deficient mouse liver. Our findings show that both temporal pattern of food intake and the circadian clock drive rhythmic transcription, thereby highlighting temporal regulation of hepatic transcription as an emergent property of the circadian system.},

abstract = {Mammalian PERIOD2 protein (PER2) is the product of a clock gene that controls circadian rhythms, because PER2-deficient mice have an arrhythmic phenotype. The nuclear entry regulation of clock gene products is a key step in proper circadian rhythm formation in both Drosophila and mammals, because the periodic transcription of clock genes is controlled by an intracellular, oscillating, negative feedback loop. The present study used deletion mutants of rat PER2 (rPER2) to identify the functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) in rPER2. The elimination of putative NLS (residues 778 to 794) from the rPER2 fragment resulted in the loss of nuclear entry activity. Adding the NLS to the cytosolic protein (bacterial alkaline phosphatase) translocates the fusion protein to the nuclei. The data indicate the presence of a functional NLS in rPER2. Furthermore, intact rPER2 was preferentially translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when coexpressed with human CRY1 (hCRY1). However, rPER2 mutants lacking a carboxyl-terminal domain could not enter the nucleus even in the presence of hCRY1. In addition, coexpression of the nuclear localization domain (residues 512 to 794) lacking rPER2 and CRY1 changed the subcellular localization of CRY1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In vitro protein interaction studies demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal domain of rPER2 is essential for binding to CRY1. The data suggested that both the rPER2 NLS and carboxyl-terminal CRY binding domain are essential for nuclear entry of the rPER2-CRY1 complex.},

abstract = {The mechanism of circadian oscillations in the period protein (PER) in Drosophila is investigated by means of a theoretical model. Taking into account recent experimental observations, the model for the circadian clock is based on multiple phosphorylation of PER and on the negative feedback exerted by PER on the transcription of the period (per) gene. This minimal biochemical model provides a molecular basis for circadian oscillations of the limit cycle type. During oscillations, the peak in per mRNA precedes by several hours the peak in total PER protein. The results support the view that multiple PER phosphorylation introduces times delays which strengthen the capability of negative feedback to produce oscillations. The analysis shows that the rhythm only occurs in a range bounded by two critical values of the maximum rate of PER degradation. A similar result is obtained with respect to the rate of PER transport into the nucleus. The results suggest a tentative explanation for the altered period of per mutants, in terms of variations in the rate of PER degradation.},

abstract = {In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central pacemaker organizing circadian rhythms of behavior and physiology. At the cellular level, the mammalian clock consists of autoregulatory feedback loops involving a set of "clock genes," including the Cryptochrome (Cry) genes, Cry1 and Cry2. Experimental evidence suggests that Cry1 and Cry2 play distinct roles in circadian clock function. In mice, Cry1 is required for sustained circadian rhythms in dissociated SCN neurons or fibroblasts but not in organotypic SCN slices or at the behavioral level, whereas Cry2 is not required at any of these levels. It has been argued that coupling among SCN cellular oscillators compensates for clock gene defects to preserve oscillatory function. Here we test this hypothesis in Cry1(-/-) mice by first disrupting intercellular coupling in vivo using constant light (resulting in behavioral arrhythmicity) and then examining circadian clock gene expression in SCN slices at the single cell level. In this manner, we were able to test the role of intercellular coupling without drugs and while preserving tissue organization, avoiding the confounding influences of more invasive manipulations. Cry1(-/-) mice (as well as control Cry2(-/-) mice) bearing the PER2::LUC knock-in reporter were transferred from a standard light:dark cycle to constant bright light (\~{}650 lux) to induce arrhythmic locomotor patterns. In SCN slices from these animals, we used bioluminescence imaging to monitor PER2::LUC expression in single cells. We show that SCN slices from rhythmic Cry1(-/-) and Cry2(-/-) mice had similarly high percentages of functional single-cell oscillators. In contrast, SCN slices from arrhythmic Cry1(-/-) mice had significantly fewer rhythmic cells than SCN slices from arrhythmic Cry2(-/-) mice. Thus, constant light in vivo disrupted intercellular SCN coupling to reveal a cell-autonomous circadian defect in Cry1(-/-) cells that is normally compensated by intercellular coupling in vivo.},

In response to different environmental stimuli, SIRT1 directly links the cellular metabolic status to the chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression, thereby modulating a variety of cellular processes such as energy metabolism and stress response. Recent studies have shown that SIRT1 controls both glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver, promotes fat mobilization and stimulates brown remodeling of the white fat in white adipose tissue, controls insulin secretion in the pancreas, senses nutrient availability in the hypothalamus, influences obesity-induced inflammation in macrophages, and modulates the activity of circadian clock in metabolic tissues. This review focuses on the role of SIRT1 in regulating energy metabolism at different metabolic tissues.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiles are an increasingly common data source that can yield insights into the functions of cells at a system-wide level. The present work considers the limitations in information content of gene expression data for reverse engineering regulatory networks. An in silico genetic regulatory network was constructed for this purpose. Using the in silico network, a formal identifiability analysis was performed that considered the accuracy with which the parameters in the network could be estimated using gene expression data and prior structural knowledge (which transcription factors regulate which genes) as a function of the input perturbation and stochastic gene expression. The analysis yielded experimentally relevant results. It was observed that, in addition to prior structural knowledge, prior knowledge of kinetic parameters, particularly mRNA degradation rate constants, was necessary for the network to be identifiable. Also, with the exception of cases where the noise due to stochastic gene expression was high, complex perturbations were more favorable for identifying the network than simple ones. Although the results may be specific to the network considered, the present study provides a framework for posing similar questions in other systems.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are self-sustained biological oscillators that can be entrained by environmental cues. Although this phenomenon has been studied in many organisms, the molecular mechanisms of entrainment remain unclear. Three cyanobacterial proteins and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are sufficient to generate oscillations in phosphorylation in vitro. We show that changes in illumination that induce a phase shift in cultured cyanobacteria also cause changes in the ratio of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). When these nucleotide changes are simulated in the in vitro oscillator, they cause phase shifts similar to those observed in vivo. Physiological concentrations of ADP inhibit kinase activity in the oscillator, and a mathematical model constrained by data shows that this effect is sufficient to quantitatively explain entrainment of the cyanobacterial circadian clock.},

We evaluate the possibility that SIRT1 lies at the heart of a regulatory loop involving PPARalpha, PGC-1alpha (PPARA, PPARGC1A as given in the HUGO Database), and lipin-1 (LPIN1 as listed in the HUGO Database) that ultimately controls the metabolic response to varying nutrient and physiological signals via a common mechanism mediated by post-translation modifications (deacetylation) of both PPARalpha and PGC-1s. Finally, we comment on the potential of pharmaceutical manipulation of these targets as well as the possible problems associated with this strategy.},

abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reportedly suppresses transcriptional activity of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase C (PEPCK-C) promoter and reduces hepatic PEPCK-C expression. Although a previous study found TORC2 phosphorylation to be involved in the suppression of AMPK-mediated CRE transcriptional activity, we herein present evidence that glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylation induced by AMPK also plays an important role. We initially found that injecting fasted mice with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) markedly increased Ser-9 phosphorylation of hepatic GSK3beta within 15 min. Stimulation with AICAR or the GSK3beta inhibitor SB-415286 strongly inhibited CRE-containing promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Using the Gal4-based transactivation assay system, the transcriptional activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) was suppressed by both AICAR and SB415286, whereas that of TORC2 was repressed significantly by AICAR but very slightly by SB415286. These results show inactivation of GSK3beta to directly inhibit CREB but not TORC2. Importantly, the AICAR-induced suppression of PEPCK-C expression was shown to be blunted by overexpression of GSK3beta(S9G) but not wild-type GSK3beta. In addition, AICAR stimulation decreased, whereas Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) increased CREB phosphorylation (Ser-129) in HepG2 cells. The time-courses of decreased CREB phosphorylation (Ser-129) and increased GSK3beta phosphorylation were very similar. Furthermore, AMPK-mediated GSK3beta phosphorylation was inhibited by an Akt-specific inhibitor in HepG2 cells, suggesting involvement of the Akt pathway. In summary, phosphorylation (Ser-9) of GSK3beta is very likely to be critical for AMPK-mediated PEPCK-C gene suppression. Reduced CREB phosphorylation (Ser-129) associated with inactivation of GSK3beta by Ser-9 phosphorylation may be the major mechanism underlying PEPCK-C gene suppression by AMPK-activating agents such as biguanide.},

abstract = {Singularity behaviour in circadian clocks--the loss of robust circadian rhythms following exposure to a stimulus such as a pulse of bright light--is one of the fundamental but mysterious properties of clocks. To quantitatively perturb and accurately measure the dynamics of cellular clocks, we synthetically produced photo-responsiveness within mammalian cells by exogenously introducing the photoreceptor melanopsin and continuously monitoring the effect of photo-perturbation on the state of cellular clocks. Here we report that a critical light pulse drives cellular clocks into singularity behaviour. Our theoretical analysis consistently predicts and subsequent single-cell level observation directly proves that desynchronization of individual cellular clocks underlies singularity behaviour. Our theoretical framework also explains why singularity behaviours have been experimentally observed in various organisms, and it suggests that desynchronization is a plausible mechanism for the observable singularity of circadian clocks. Importantly, these in vitro and in silico findings are further supported by in vivo observations that desynchronization underlies the multicell-level amplitude decrease in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus induced by critical light pulses.},
