Dear Editor,

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled "Quantifying stochastic noise in
cultured circadian reporter cells" by Peter C. St. John and Francis J. Doyle
III, which we are submitting for publication in *PLOS Computational Biology* as
a Research Article.

Circadian rhythms are cell-autonomous 24-hour oscillations in gene transcription
and play an integral role in coordinating metabolic processes in many species.
Due to low molecular counts at the single-cell level, stochastic noise plays an
important role in determining the output of the circadian gene regulatory
network. However, quantifying the amount of noise present, specifically in
response to a perturbation, is experimentally difficult. In this study we
demonstrate that a reasonable description of the cell-autonomous noise can be
gained by analyzing the damping profiles of data collected from entire cell
cultures. Such a method is particularly useful for its applicability to the
large wealth of existing experimental data from which new insights might be
gained. We feel that this article would be an excellent fit for 
*PLOS Computational Biology* not only due to the journal's large readership in
circadian rhythms specifically, but also since our article demonstrates the
importance of multi-scale systems biology: incorporating elements from
molecular-level simulations up through high-throughput biological screens.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not
under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript
and agree with its submission toÂ *PLOS Computational Biology*. We look forward
to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

Francis J. Doyle III
